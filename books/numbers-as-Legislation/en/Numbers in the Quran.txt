Introduction: From the Letter to the Number

The Discourse… The Balance… and an Existence that Articulates Itself Numerically

The entire universe is a language.
Language, in its essence, is not merely sounds or symbols, but the breath of existence as it expresses itself.
From the letter to the word, and from the word to the number, the Divine Utterance extends into existence as an open book for those who comprehend the balance.

The Quran does not speak only in letters, but also in measures, numbers, and proportions,
because the number is the manifestation of order within the word, just as the word is the manifestation of consciousness within the number.
The letter expresses *the essence*; the number expresses *the destiny*.
Between essence and destiny lies the balance upon which the universe is established:

*"And We sent down with them the Scripture and the Balance so that people may uphold justice."* (Al-Hadid: 25).

The Discourse is the visible aspect of wisdom.
The Balance is the aspect that is measured, estimated, and precisely calculated in all things:

*"Indeed, We have created all things according to a precise measure."* (Al-Qamar: 49).

In light of this balance, the number in the Quran is not merely a numerical label,
but rather a cosmic voice that carries the meaning of existence and its harmony.
Every number in the Quran is not a quantity to be counted, but a measure by which the balance between the manifest and the hidden, between the Law (*Sharia*) and the Reality (*Haqiqa*), is determined.

From Letter to Number: The Journey from Enunciation to Balance

The letter is the first seed of language.
The number is the first seed of order.
Creation begins with the "Word" — "Be" —
But the order of creation is based on “number,” which distributes the Word in its times and quantities.
The Quran was revealed in letters to explain the truth.
And numbers were embedded within it to reveal the divine measure.
When God mentions “seven heavens,” “nine groups,” or “forty nights,”
He is not merely giving us a number for counting.
Rather, He is revealing *the ratio* between creation and command, between time and consciousness.
Every number in the Quran carries two dimensions:
*   An Apparent Legislative Dimension: God uses it to organize human affairs and worship.
*   An Inner Formative Dimension: God uses it to organize the movement of existence itself.

In this sense, the jurisprudence of numbers becomes part of the jurisprudence of language.
And the number becomes in the Qur'an a gateway to understanding the harmony between the cosmic order and the legal system.
It also becomes a tool for expanding awareness from quantity to quality.

Numerical Awareness: From Enumeration to Comprehensiveness

Enumeration is the beginning of science.
But comprehensiveness is its perfection.
God Almighty said:
*"And He has enumerated all things."* (Al-Jinn: 28).

Divine enumeration is not a mere collection of numbers, but rather a comprehensive encompassing of realities.
When the Quran calls upon man to enumerate (*"Over it are nineteen"* [Al-Muddaththir: 30]),
it is in fact calling him to reflect on the meaning of the number, not merely to count it.
So that he may understand how numbers express hidden ratios between the unseen and the seen,
And how enumeration transforms into awareness, quantity into quality, and knowledge into direct witnessing.

Between Enunciation and Balance: The Human Being

The human being himself is inscribed between the letter and the number:
*   On one hand, he is a word from the words of God.
*   On the other hand, he is predetermined by number, term, and balance.

Just as language gives him the ability to express himself,
Numbers grant him an awareness of the universal system.
Thus, he combines spirit and form, inner reality and outer measure.
So that he may be the scale by which God tests His creation:
*"We have certainly created man in the best of stature."* (At-Tin: 4).

Conclusion of the Introduction: From Quantity to Quality

In this book, we do not read numbers as signals for calculation,
But rather as signs that reveal levels of divine consciousness in creation, law, and spirit.
The number in the Quran is not merely a “quantity,”
but rather a symbol of modality, a key to awareness, and a path to a unified understanding of existence.
Enunciation begins with the letter.
The Balance is revealed through numbers.
In man, expression and balance meet so that existence becomes a measured word, intoning the melody of truth.

The Book's Purpose and Methodology

This book is an attempt to interpret numbers in the Quran as a language of revelation.
It is not limited to numerical miracles or mathematical enumeration.
Rather, it reads numbers as one aspect of the divine discourse by which God organizes creation, law, and consciousness together.
The purpose of this work is the shift from quantity to quality:
From number as a unit of account, to number as a symbol of universal consciousness.
Quantity describes the apparent, while quality reveals the hidden.
And from the meeting of the apparent and the hidden, the Divine Balance is revealed, to which the Quran refers in the Almighty’s saying:
*"It is God who has created seven heavens and of the earth, the like of them. The Command descends among them."* (At-Talaq: 12).

In this balance, numbers are transformed into vessels of meaning,
used to demonstrate the balance between:
• Creation and Command
• Time and Eternity,
• The Law (*Sharia*) and the Reality (*Haqiqa*),
• Man and the Universe.

The Book's Methodology

This book is based on a three-part structured approach, combining:

1. Qur'anic Linguistic Analysis:
    Deriving the original meanings of the numerical root in the Qur'an and the Arabic language,
    to illustrate the subtle differences between words (such as 'one' and 'alone', or 'seven' and 'seventy').

2. Contextual and Intentional Reading:
    Tracing the contexts in which numbers appear in the Qur'an and linking each number to the purpose for which it was mentioned.
    Because the number in the Qur’anic text is inseparable from its semantic field.

3. Spiritual and Existential Contemplation:
    Reading numbers as rungs on the ladder of human consciousness,
    reflecting levels of ascent from mere perception to unification.
    So that each number becomes a station of Quranic awareness.

Between Knowledge and Contemplation

This book does not seek to create a new numerical theory.
Nor to support formalistic arguments about numerical miracles.
Rather, it offers a Jurisprudence of Number that restores the balance between thought and remembrance.
It restores to the number its aesthetic dimension as a voice from the chorus of existence.
It is an invitation to disciplined contemplation:
An open-ended reflection, yet one that adheres to the principles of language and revelation.
So that the door remains open for research, while being closed to arbitrariness and affectation.

Summary of the Goal

We must learn to read numbers, not just count them.
We must understand how God organizes existence through them.
And how a person can learn from them the balance within his own soul and his time.

Part One: Numbers as Legislation — From Order to Consciousness
Introduction to the section
When we examine the Qur'anic discourse, we find that numbers in the legislative field do not appear as a rigid mathematical matter.
Rather likeA precise system that links justice and awareness, appreciation and compassion, order and balance..
God Almighty does not mention numbers in legislation merely for the sake of control or enumeration.
Rather, to educate man through it onThe Jurisprudence of Balance؛
A balance between effort and reward, between action and consequence.
Between the limits of the body and the vastness of the soul.
Therefore, numbers in legislation often appear in three contexts:
1. Organization of worship and time— Such as the days of fasting, the months of Hajj, and the times of prayer.
2. Regulating human relations— Such as the waiting period, inheritance, and divorce.
3. Establishing the principle of punishment— In expiations, multiplications, and good deeds.
These are not just numbers to capture reality, butSpiritual rhythmsIt preserves the balance of human existence.
Worship in Islam is not a time-bound burden, but rather a movement measured by the scale of numbers.
Where repetition becomes a reminder,
Numerical control is transformed into a harmony between cosmic rhythm and human rhythm.

Numbers in legislation: from command to understanding
On the surface, the numbers in the Quran specify quantities,
But deep down, it determinesThe distance between man and the sky.
When God says:
“Fasting has been prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may attain piety.”(Al-Baqarah: 183)
Then he explains:
"A few days")..«Al-Baqarah: 184
It links counting with piety, measure with purpose.
The number hereTime for purificationNot just a time limit.
Thus, numerical legislation is transformed intoA method for cultivating awareness of time and self.

From system to consciousness
The number in Islamic legislation is a form ofThe divine order in creation:
The planets move according to a specific measure, and the Earth according to a specific measure.
Similarly, the actions of the servant are weighed according to their measure and number.
So that one side does not overshadow the other,
A person does not lose their balance between worldly work and the tranquility of the afterlife.
Understanding the numerical system in legislation means learning to live by it.Balance of existence.
Every number mentioned in a legislative context isA lesson in balance:
● (One) for monotheism,
● (Two) for justice and integrity,
● (Three) for balance,
● (Seven) for perfection,
● (Forty) to reach maturity...
These are levels in human awareness of the divine order.
And stations in his journey from obedience to insight.

The purpose of this section
In this section of the book, we will attempt to read the numbers in Qur'anic legislation.
A double reading that combines:
● Practical Apparent UnderstandingThe one who organizes daily life,
● andExistential esoteric understandingWhich develops awareness of God through the numerical system.
And we will start fromorigin— The One and Only —
Then we proceed with the numbers as they manifest in the human journey from awareness of unity to awareness of order.
The number in legislation is not a matter of restriction.
but rather A gateway to liberation through awareness؛
To learn how to weigh your life on God's scales.
You realize that obedience is not a counting of movements, but rather justice in positions.


Chapter 1 – The One and Only: The Origin of Rebirth
Say, "He is God, the One."
Surah Al-Ikhlas is not merely a declaration of faith, but it isFirst gateway to awareness؛
Returning to the point from which the universe emerged, and to the silence that preceded words.
And to the unity that preceded multiplicity.
When we readOneWe are not reading a number.
Rather, we readOrigin of existenceBefore it branches out.
The number hereNot an account, but rather presence.
"One" isThe principle of counting:
The sequence begins with it, and from it the numbers emerge.
As for "Sunday" it isAll of it before the count:
It is the existence thatNot to be repeated،
It is indivisible.
The number does not apply to it at all.
One can be followed by "two" and "three".
As for Sunday, there is nothing after it, nothing before it, and nothing with it.
he A point that has no adjacent points.
Thus, the Quran opens for us a precise distinction between:
The conceptexistential significancespiritual significanceOneSource of abundanceBeginning to get to know GodSundayA fact that cannot be overstatedEmanation of the self in presenceOneidentification،
And SundayWitnesses.
OneLogic،
And SundayOthers.

Awareness of Sunday: The First Moment of Revelation
When the heart dwells in the presence of "Sunday",
Images fall away, shapes fade away.
The desire to compare, contrast, and possess fades away.
This moment is not a cognitive experience.
but rather Existential exposure:
● Where you do not see yourself as separate from existence,
● Nor is existence separate from its source.
● And the source is onlyOne without limits.
That is, awareness of the One
It's not an idea you're thinking about.
but rather vigilanceShe is taken to it.
He who has not tasted, has not known.

From Sunday to One: The Descent of Consciousness into the Many
After the witnesses comes the oud.
Consciousness descends from the presence of Sunday
To the world of the One,
Then to the world of Monday,
Then to the world of multiplicity.
But it descendsknowing this time,
Neither oblivious nor lost.
Having tasted the original,
He never forgot the spring.
He began to see multiplicity — but he did not lose sight of solitude.
He lives in the world — but does not dissolve into it.
He deals with things — but is not enslaved by them.
here The soul matures.

✦Sign of awareness
Every journey in existence
It starts on Sunday,
And ends on Sunday,
وتمتدّ بينهما کقوس نور.
Whoever knows Sunday
He is no longer a prisoner of the masses.
And one who witnessed
He is no longer torn between the images.
The journey begins with one word:
Say.
Tell yourself.
Say it.
Tell your confusion.
Tell me about your large numbers.
He is God, the One.


Chapter 2 – The Two: The Law of Duality and the Birth of Balance
And of everything We created pairs, that you may remember.
This is not only a marvel in cosmological physics, butA statement about the nature of existence itself.
The universe does not appear in the form of "one".
until It manifests.
And when it manifests — it appears intwo.
Sunday The reality of existence before its appearance.
The twoBeginning of its appearance.
Two is not a large number.
but rather A mirror to each other.
Male and female,
Night and day,
The soul and the body,
The mind and the heart,
Light and shadow.
They are not opposites.
but rather Two halves of one face.

Duality is not conflict — it is harmony
When the human mind is ignorant,
It boils down to:
Good/Evil
Light/Dark
I/They
He thinks the universe is a battleground.
But the Quran does not present duality as a conflict.
Rather likeAmount.
Night does not fight day.
Rather, it complements it.
The sea is not hostile to the coast.
Rather, it draws its boundaries.
The body does not oppose the soul.
Rather, he carries it.
We are only in pain
When we forgetOriginal unit
And we see things.SeparatedAbout each other.

Duality in the human soul
Man is a soul that wavers:
between LightsandHer shadow،
between Its stillnessandAnxieties.
The goal is not to eliminate either of them.
but rather ReconciliationBetween them.
The fault is not in the shadow,
But rather, in forgetting the light.
Shame is not in the body.
Rather, it is in taking it alone as the reference for existence.
The problem is not the multiplicity of voices.
But inLoss of the lighthouseWhich directs it.
Neither of them needs to win.
Rather tobending towards each other
Until the body becomes stable, just as a ship becomes stable on water.

The two are in love
Love in its essence
he to rememberThat souls come from one source,
Then they dispersed
To recognize herself in the mirror of the other.
That is why the Quran says:
"And He placed between you affection and mercy."
Affection is a connection.
And mercy is protection.
Love is not about possession.
but rather Awareness of the connection.
Not "you and me"
Rather, “we are of one origin.”

From one to two — then back
Existence begins on Sunday.
It appears on both sides.
It reproduces by three or more.
Then he returns in the deepest moments of witnessing
to Sunday.
This is amazing Spiritual cycle
It is the law of everything:
The star, the cell, the soul, the universe, and man.
The real test is not seeing the One in the One,
Rather, to seeSunday on Monday.
To see unity within multiplicity.
To see God in everything
No, asimage
Rather likepedigreed.

Sign of awareness
Everything you see around youmirror.
Everything you think is separation — is actually connection.
Every contradiction you see — isharmonious danceShe still doesn't understand her music.
The two are not a difference.
Both are ways for one to express oneself.


Chapter 3 – The Three: Existence is based on pillars

And for existencebalance،
For balanceBody.
Existence was not based on only two.
If the two of them were left alone, they would remain in a state of constant tension.
They meet, they converse, and perhaps their silence clashes.
In order for the two to settle down,
They needthird
Supports the relationship
It gives it meaning and direction.
The third is not an increase in number,
but rather Perfection in formation.

The three are the core of the structure: spirit – soul – body
Spirit alone is not enough.
Nor the body alone,
Not consciousness alone.

DistanceIts natureHis jobthe spiritbreath of lightupward trendselfConflict sitefield of educationThe bodyTime carrierAppearance toolIf one of them is defective
The human being became disturbed.
If the soul becomes tyrannical,
The soul grew dark.
The weakness of the body,
The effort was disrupted.
If the soul is gone,
Man has become nothing more than a machine.
The threeYou need some
Do not contradict
It does not separate.

The three in the universe: beginning – middle – end
Every cycle of existence takes place in three forms:
● Dawn – Day – Night
● Seed – Plant – Fruit
● Childhood – Maturity – Old Age
● Beginning – Journey – Arrival
The three are notTime periodsOnly,
but rather Levels of awareness.
Dawn is not a time.
but rather The birth of meaning.
Night is not darkness,
but rather The womb of withdrawal into the self.

The three on the path to God
The traveler does not walk in a straight line.
Rather, it is an arc based on three degrees:
1. Knowledge
Knowing the way: “How? Why? And where to?”
2. Process
The movement that gives knowledge a body.
3. Presence
The moment of revelation that cannot be grasped through study.
Rather, it is granted.
Without knowledge, one goes astray.
Without work, he lives.
Without attendance, it dries up.
The three are not doors,
but rather Layers of consciousness breathe each other.

The three in the Quran
When God described the angels, He said:
"Those with wings, two, three, and four"
These are not numbers for counting wings.
but rather Layers of the Forces of Existence:
● Dual → Balance
● The three → standing
● Quadrant → Extension
The three of them are hereEquation state
Before expanding into the four directions.

Sign of awareness
The three areFirst perfection.
It is the arc that holds the circle together before it closes.
It is the moment when meaning becomesAble to continue.
Who doesn't know the three?
He remains torn between his soul and his body.
And those who witnessed it
I realized that insidesmall throne
It rests on three pillars of light.


Chapter 4 – The Four: The Four Directions and the Spread of the Earth
The Most Merciful is established on the Throne.
Levelness is not movement, nor transition, nor place…
but rather Announcement of the completion of the balanceIn existence.
If itThe threeIt is the establishment of the structure.
forThe four she Its expansion and spreadIn the directions.
Four is not a number,
but rather A new level of awareness:
The awareness that everything hasFace and extension.
The eye also sees at an angle,
You cannot see the truth unless you broaden its scope.
To include all four directions.

Directions are not places — but positions
We say:
East, West, North, and South.
But the Quran does not speak ofsensory trendsOnly,
But aboutinner horizonExistence is distributed within it:
The entityspiritual meaningWhat it reveals inside a personthe EastDawnThe beginning of awarenessWestabsence of lightReliability testNorthThe flow of driving forcesbreath movementSouthThe seat of silencepeace of mindEvery human
It carries within itEast and West،
And north and south.
Anything carriesHe concealed the light and its shadow, its movement and its stillness.
Therefore, God Almighty said:
"Lord of the two Easts and Lord of the two Wests"
Because the East in you is not one
Nor is Morocco like that in you.
You small universe
Within you, all directions breathe.

The four as a widening after completion
She was The threeStanding up,
When the structure was erected,
She had toOpen.
The four areOpenness of existence
On the move.
After stability →Publication.
After the shape →place.
After the nucleus →area.
It's a moment to say:
"Here I am,
And I move in directions of meaning.
Existence is not a prison.
but rather Extension."

The four in the human heart
The heart is restless
Unless it is based onfour pillars:
1. sincerity
2. safety
3. breadth
4. Hello
If one of them is defective
The authorities inside were in turmoil.
Honesty givesYour east is light،
Security givesYour west is tranquility،
The width givesTo your north, horizon،
Peace givesYour south is tranquil.
Then
The heart is no longer a narrow house.
but rather flat land.

The throne has eight — but the earth has four
Because the throneCeiling of awareness،
And the earthExperimental field.
The four arewalking range،
And the eight areThe goal of reaching.
Between the earth and the throne
The road extendsThe traveler in God.

Sign of awareness
If you feel thatEnclosed،
The world is not small.
but rather Your field of vision has not yet expanded..
Do not move your body from one place.
Rather, shift your awareness from one side.
Man is not a product of distance.
Rather, it is the son of the trend.
When your inner horizons expand,
The ground becomes before youcarpet
It extends as far asYour light.

Chapter 5 – The Five: Between the Unseen and the Seen
And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him.
The unseen is not unknown… ratherHidden.
The hijab is not about concealment… butbreeding.
Five is not a random number,
that it The gateway that separates what the eye sees,
And what is revealed to the heart.
When God Almighty said:
"Five things that only God knows."
He did not set limits to knowledge.
Rather, it wasIt reveals the structure of existence:
That there is something to be given,
There are things that can only be given when awareness has matured.
The unseenNot a deficiencyIn human knowledge,
but rather mercyHis protection from seeing what is unbearable.

The five as a law of passage
The world is seen on two levels:
LevelWhat we seeWhat we don't knowCertificateImageThe shadow lurking behind itThe unseenlatent lightThe truth before it takes shapeThe testimony is not true.
The unseen is not a mystery.
CertificateRiver surface،
The unseenIts depth.
When we sink to the surface,
We forget that a river has a source.
He has a decision.

The five daily prayers — a daily journey
Not five prayersTime calendarOnly,
but rather LadderBetween the unseen and the seen.
● dawn
The moment the soul emerges from its night into the light.
● noon
The body is exposed under the glow of life.
● The era
The test of balance lies in the heart of preoccupation.
● Morocco
The images fade, and things return to their origins.
● dinner
The return of consciousness to its original womb.
Prayer is not an action.
but rather Continuous return to Where did you come from, and where are you going back to?.
It doesn't just remind you of God,
Rather, it reminds youTake care of yourself before you forget.

The Five Senses — Doors to the Inside
The five are not only in worship,
Rather, it is in the very formation of man himself.
Your ear, your eye, your skin, your nose, your tongue —
They are not tools for communicating with the world.
but rather Windows through which consciousness sees itself.
If the senses are corrupted,
Perception was corrupted.
And if you become civilized,
It refines the heart.
The senses are not a bridge to the outside world.
but rather A bridge to the interior as well.

The Five: A fine line between falling and rising
The unseen, if it is revealed before its time
It becomesstrife.
And the certificate, if it becomes inflated
It becomesprison.
And man is always walking
On this thin thread
Between them.
Five is not a barrier.
but rather balance.

Sign of awareness
Do not ask for a revelation of the unseen.
RequestHeart maturity.
If the heart matures,
Unveiling the unseenWithout asking.
The unseen cannot be summoned.
but rather Welcome.
The certificate is not rejected.
but rather CleanseUntil it becomes a clear mirror.
Everything is present.
But you can only see it to the extent of your purity.


Chapter 6 – The Six: The Time of Formation and the Logic of Gradualism

He created the heavens and the earth in six days.
The question is not:How many is six?
but rather: Why not one?
And why not a single moment of absolute will?
God does not need time to create.
ButThe universe needs time to accept existence.
Six is ​​not a duration.
but rather A place where things mature before they appear.
The idea is not born fully formed,
The river does not overflow all at once.
A tree does not sprout from a seed without a long period of dormancy in the darkness.
Likewise, existence is not bestowed all at once.
but rather It comes in layers of manifestation.
Six is ​​not a number.
but rather The law of formation.

The logic of gradualism: existence cannot tolerate leaps.
Everything born prematurely
It is born fragile.
And everything that forces one to rush
It loses its essence.
God Existence does not force itself into the light،
but rather It accompanies it as the fruit ripens.
Thus:
● The soul does not mature in one night.
● The heart is not purified in one sitting.
● Consciousness is not formed from a single reading.
Consciousness — like creation —
NeedsHis six special days:
1. Beginning of awareness
2. resistance
3. confusion
4. Accepted
5. Stability
6. sunshine
Then comesComfort —
Not as a lazy person, but as aLevelness.

Creation in six days = the descent of existence layer by layer
The world is not merely a form,
that it The story of the descent.
● From the unseen to the light
● From meaning to image
● From Sunday to the Multiple Manifestation
This descentIt doesn't happen all at once.
Because if the soul were to face the whole truth
Lanhart.
Therefore we say:
Every spiritual revelation
It comes inCompassionate layers.
The six areDivine kindness towards consciousness.

The six in man
The universe has six layers of manifestation.
Similarly, humans have six stages of internal development:
StageIts natureIts goal1. FeelingThe beginning of awakeningAttention2. UnderstandingCapturing the first linescomprehension3. ConflictThe old resists rebirthSorting4. RefractionThe fall of the illusionopenness5. StillnessBreathing still after movementreassurance6. ManifestationLight emanating from withinSeeing God in thingsAnd only when it is completeThe six
It comessilenceThe one who says everything without words.

Seventh rest: Leveling up, not stopping
The seventh day in creation
Not a job,
but rather Witnesses.
God does not need rest.
But existence requiresUntil the moment it settles down to be seen.
Thus:
After the effort:Sakina.
After the effort:pause.
After the movement:Presence.
Rest is not a break from work.
but rather An openness to seeing what has been formed.
You do not see the meaning of your steps
Except when you pause for a moment
And she breathes.

Sign of awareness
Don't rush what is meant to ripen.
Don't open the rose before its time.
Do not ask for the sea to part before the night has fully fallen within you.
The universe was created slowly.
And the heart too.
He who understands the secret of the six
He is no longer afraid of being late.
He does not get impatient waiting.
He doesn't dislike the road.
Gradualism is a blessing.
Maturity is calmness.
And the light always comes… after the sea has calmed down.


Chapter 7 – The Seven: The Completed Cycles and the Open Sky
And We have created above you seven heavens.
The sky is not seven layers stacked together,
but rather Seven levels of consciousnessThe spirit rises between them step by step.
Existence does not happen all at once.
It does not manifest itself without gradual steps.
forEvery completion reveals itself only in seven.
Seven isCosmic completeness form.
● Seven heavens
● Seven lands
● Seven verses in Al-Fatiha
● Seven circuits of the circumambulation
● Seven days for the time cycle
● Seven Doors to Inner Existence
Seven is not a repetition.
but rather Rotation.
Seven is not a limit,
but rather a movement.

The Seven Degrees: From Earth to Heaven
Human beings begin withthe earth
Any of the body's weight
And he heads towardsthe sky
That is, towards lightness of spirit.
Between the earth and the sky
Seven layers of filtration:
DegreeIts natureWhat the heart relieves1. Physical self-awarenessmaterialistic egoAttachment to desires2. Self-awareness of emotional stateFluctuationThe constant need for external certification3. Mind perceptionAccumulation of ideasRelying on understanding alone4. Perception of insightWitnesses beginImage projection5. Understanding the secretStillnessBreaking away from inner noise6. Spiritual awarenessContactSeeing God in everything7.

that it It melts the weight layer by layer
As the snow melts from the top downwards.

Circumambulating the Kaaba — a seven-step cycle to rearrange the interior
A person does not circle a stone.
But aboutOrigin point.
In each cycle
It leaves behind something of its old self:
First cycle — leaving distraction
Second — it leaves anxiety
Third — Leaves the fear
Fourth — Leave the clinging
Fifth — Leaves the picture
Sixth — Leaves the name
Seventh —It goes out in the presence of Sunday
And when his name is turned off
OnlyHis Lord's face.

Seven as the rhythm of time
The week is not an artificial division of the calendar.
but rather Breathing rhythm.
On the seventh day
Nothing new is created.
Rather, things are seenAs it is.
Seventh Day
It is a momentAwareness
Which follows all the other days and is not like them.
that it The day the door opens.

The seven mentioned in the Quran is not a number… but a testament to the law of testimony.
Al-Fatiha has seven verses
Because sheThe complete cycle of returning to God.
● It begins withPraise be to God→ Opening
● And ends withThe straight path→ Direction
Between them
The entire human journey
From the beginning,
To the point of being lost,
To return.

Sign of awareness
Everything that was not completed will return.
Everything that is not healed will reappear.
Everything that is not understood will be repeated in another form.
The seven tell you:
The circle will not close unless you are fully present.
If your cycle is complete,
Heaven has been opened for you.
And if there remains within you something that has not been understood,
The road has returned… with mercy, not punishment.
Everything is coming back together.
Nothing is left incomplete.


Part Two: Number as a Cosmic Symbol — From Creation to Manifestation
Introduction to the section
In the first part of this book, we traced the number in its legislative field — where God regulates human life with it,
In a balanced rhythm between acts of worship and times, between action and intention, between order and intention.
In this second part, we move fromJurisprudence of the system to Jurisprudence of Existence،
From legislation to formation,
From a number that organizes human action to a number that expresses the architecture of creation itself.
The number in the Quran is not limited to the boundaries of human time.
But it extends toCosmic time،
Where the number becomesA language of manifestationNot a measuring tool.
When God Almighty says:
“Allah is He Who created seven heavens and of the earth, their like.”(Divorce: 12),
It does not provide numerical information, butA reference to the system of existence in its layers and harmony.

✦Number in formation: From quantity to meaning
Every number in creation carries a dual dimension:
● quantitativelyIt refers to an order or quantity,
● andqualitativelyIt refers to an existential and spiritual significance.
The One is the origin of all multiplicity.
The two are the principle of mating.
And (the three) are the balance scale,
And (the seven) is the perfection of the system.
As for (eight), it isBeginning of expansion after completion،
The point at which the universe opens up to the secret of manifestation.
The numbers in creation are not mere numerical decorations,
but rather Maps of ConsciousnessIt shows how existence progresses from unity to multiplicity, and from quantity to quality.
Until it reaches the stage of the throne — the center of the greatest balance,
It is carried by the number eight, not just by the number, butWith pillars of strength and light.

From creation to manifestation
When we read numbers in the context of creation, we read with themThe rhythm of divine manifestationIn the universe:
● (Six days) are the stages of formation,
● And (seven heavens) are the layers of existence.
● (Eight) is the station of ascending towards the throne, towards the expansion of human understanding of the divine secret.
Creation, in its essence, is not merely a physical act;
but rather universal consciousness process،
The Qur’an translates it through numbers that represent spiritual ratios between divine action and cosmic manifestation.
In this context, the number is “the linguistic shadow of creation”,
Creation is “the existential voice of number”.

✦From order to light
If the first part revealed the consistency betweenNumber and system،
This part reveals the consistency betweenNumber and light.
Every number in the system of creation isA level of divine manifestation،
The more a person's awareness of these levels expands,
His ability to witness increased, not to judge.
Thus, the jurisprudence of numbers becomes here.Knowledge of the cosmic balance،
It teaches man to see light in every measure.
And in every system there is a manifestation of power.
And in every number there is a fingerprint of the One and Only God.

Conclusion of the introduction
The number in this section is not a law to be obeyed.
but rather A verse to be seen.
It is the language the universe uses to communicate with its creator.
And the scale by which the levels of existence are measured.
Whoever understands the numerical system in legislation, organizes his life.
Whoever understands the number in creation will witness the manifestation of God in everything.

Chapter 8 – The Eight: The Vastness of Existence and the Bearing of the Throne

And eight angels will bear the Throne of your Lord above them on that Day.
The throne is not a seat.
Those who carry it are not carrying it by shoulder or by force.
The throne is the center of existence.
And the eight areIts strengths, its vastness, and its expansion.
the throneGod's place is notGod is above being confined to a place.
Rather, itCosmic Balance Point:
Where existence settles
And it takes on the meaning
It is organized in harmony.
And all harmony
He needsA document of eight.

From seven to eight: From completeness to openness
● Seven = a complete cycle
● Eight =Opening after completion
The seven are like a circle that has closed on its light.
eight likeThe door that opens in the wall
To allow the light to spread.
that it The transition from levelness to motion,
From balance to expansion.
The seven teach you how to beComplete،
As for the eight, they will teach youHow can you give from what you have been perfected with?

The eight as arms of expansion
Also, the human being withinFour directions
And outsideFour other directions
He uses it to deal with the world:
InsideoutsideEast of the HeartEast RelationsWest HeartWestern relationsNorth of the soulNorth of the verbsSouth of tranquilitySouth BehaviorFour + Four
It doesn't just equal eight mathematically,
but rather double width:
● Expansion inInside
● and expansion inoutside
The eight areThe moment when your inner self and outer self become equal
So do not be light inside and chaos outside.
Do not be soft on the outside and hard on the inside.
that it Unifying faces.

Campaign for the Throne — Powers, not bodies
The wise men said:
"The pillars of preserving existence are four:
Wisdom – Justice – Mercy – Strength.
And man has four other things that preserve his journey towards God:
"Patience – certainty – gratitude – contentment."
The eight are:
The top fourThe four lowlywisdomPatienceJusticeConfidencemercyto thankpowerRezaWhen all of this comes together in a person,
His heart itself becomes a small throne
Surrounded by angels.
Not metaphorically,
but rather The reality of consciousness.

The eight in the spiritual movement
The seven was a circle.
The eightdoor.
The door through which the seeker exits
From the uniqueness of his experience
to Service of Existence.
From "I am purifying myself"
to
"I light up."
From "How am I?"
to
"How do I leave a mark?"
Eight is the denominator:
Abundance, generosity, expansion.

Sign of awareness
Do not hide your light when it is complete.
Completion is not the end of the road.
but rather The beginning of the emergence.
If you reach seven — open the door.
If it ripens — then bear fruit.
If it is complete — then shine.
Because if the light is blocked, it goes out.
And if it is released, it becomes a star in the night.


Chapter 9 – The Nine: The Edge of Exposure
Nine is the number thatIt reaches fullness
But heIt hasn't exploded yet..
that it Arch peak
Where the soul stands
And she looks down from above
Before you cross.
Also, the fetus is not born in the eighth month.
But when it is completedNinth month.
Not because time creates life,
But becauseCompletion requires its final moment.
A moment of silence…
Before the emergence.

Nine is not perfection, but a threshold.
The seven are complete.
The eight opened.
The nine…Get ready.
Nine is not satisfaction.
It is not stability.
And it's not the end.
that it Slight vibration at the edge
Before the creature crosses from
Knowledge → to the witnesses
From understanding → to taste
From knowledge → tobirth.
Nine is a moment:
"Something is about to happen."

Why is there no number ten in the Quran before the appearance of nine?
Because tenUnlivableUntil you are born.
And childbirth requiresnine.
It's not a coincidence
that:
● A human is born after nine months
● Seven circumambulations + Sa'i between Safa and Marwa = 9 spiritual paths
● There are nine gates of perception in Sufism.
● The degrees of the soul in the Quran are nine transformations
The nine areTransformation zone.

The nine is a moment of self-confrontation
after:
● Civilization
● Gradual
● Balance
● completion
● openness

She stands before youlast time.
At nine
Don't test your strength
but rather Honestly.
Do you really want God?
Or do you want a picture of him?
Are you looking for light?
Or is it about a desire to be told, “You have arrived”?
The nine reveal the intention
Wordless
Without explanations
Without evidence.
At nine o'clock, nobody lies.
Because the edge does not allow for artificiality.

The nine as a law: No crossing without breaking
No one enters through the tenth door
It is as it is.
No one moves to a new position
He retains his old image.
The nine tell you:
Break the picture before it breaks.
Bow down before you are forced to bow down.
Lighten up before you strip.
The real transformation
It doesn't require strength
but rather Daring towards lightness.

Sign of awareness
When you feel you have arrived,
Know that you are atThe nine.
When you feel that the road is no longer open to you,
Know that the doorOne step is needed, not a step with the heart, but with the foot.
Nine is not the end.
that it entrance.
The entrances are not opened by roads.
but rather By attendance.
Be quiet.
Whoops.

Leave behind what weighs you down.
The door will know who you are —
Then it opens.

Chapter 10 – Ten: Completion and the Dawn of the New Light

Ten is not more than nine.
but rather Transition of type.
The nine had reached its limit:
Fullness… readiness… slight tension before eruption.
The ten are:
The veil has fallen.
The door opened.
Light returns to its source.
The ten do not reveal anything new.
Rather, it declares thatWhat was growing in secret has come to light.
As the fetus is born
Not suddenly,
Absolutely.

Ten is not a numerical perfection—but a rotational perfection.
ten iszero + one.
NumberIts spiritual meaningOneThe beginning of existencezeroNon-thingness of originWhen one returns and stands inside zero
Existence is restored toThe presence of the beginning after the experience of abundance.
The ten say:
I have returned to the original
But youI am not the same as I used to be.
this time Arif.

The Ten: The Light Returns to Himself
God Almighty said:
And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and justice.
Perfection is not the completion of form.
but rather The meaning is complete.
Every word from God beginsNoura،
Then go down toimage،
Then it is tested inTime،
Then it returns to its light —refinery.
This is the law of ten:
The light is tested and then returns.
Therefore, God Almighty said regarding the trial of Abraham:
So he completed them
He returned from the experience
And it has becomeA new human being.

The ten in the journey of the soul
If eight represents openness,
The nine is the threshold.
The ten are:
● Liberation from duality
● Extinguishing in the light
● Starting anew without the past as a burden
The past is not forgotten.
but rather Melted.
The wound cannot be erased.
but rather It transforms into insight.
The heart is not purified.
but rather It becomes a sea.

The ten as the birth of the second consciousness
There are two births for man:
1. The birth of the body
2. Birth of the soul
First birthIt puts you in the world.
Second birthIt unlocks the meaning of the world for you.
In the second birth:
Things around you don't change.
but You are the one who changes.
● You see with light, not just with reason.
● You hear with tranquility, not just with your senses.
● It moves from within, not from without.
Here you no longer need to look for evidence,
Because youYou became the guide.

✦Sign of awareness
Don't call what's happening to you right now a "change".
The change is superficial.
What's happening is much deeper.
You Return to your original self
Which was before the fear
Before the picture
Before the name.
The ten tell you:
Get up.
I have been reborn.


Part Three: Large Numbers — From Individual to Group
Introduction to the section
In the previous two parts, we embarked on a journey from the inside out:
The number, as legislation, guides the individual's behavior and regulates the system of worship.
To the number as a cosmic symbol that reveals the system of creation and the manifestations of existence.
But in this third part, we rise to the levelLarge numbers —
Where the number transforms from a signifier toorderTo indicaterelationship،
From the individual's balance with himself toThe community's balance with its Lord and with the world.
Here the number becomesa socio-spiritual structure،
It can only be understood in the context of the community, the message, and the assignment.
It's a stageThe transition from individual consciousness to collective consciousness،
Where numbers are embodied in nations, tribes, and peoples,
And where numbers become a language for distributing roles and tasks in building both the individual and the nation.

Numbers in a group: From diversity to harmony
The Quran teaches us that multiplicity is not division, but ratherA difference intended to complement:
"And We made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another."(Al-Hujurat: 13).
The higher we climb the ladder of numbers,
Its social and existential meaning has broadened:
From (one) the singular self,
To (two) the relationship of integration,
To (seven) the perfection of creation,
Then to (twelve) where the single group branches out into a system of ratios, tasks and functions.
A large number does not necessarily mean a numerical abundance.
but rather Expansion of the circles of awareness.
For example, "twelve" is not just the number of tribes or months,
Rather, it is a symbol of the order of time and humanity around a single axis —Unity in diversity.

From the individual to the group: The process of consciousness
When a person contemplates the numbers in the Qur'an, he realizes that his journey is also a journey of the numbers themselves:
● It starts fromOne— Self-awareness.
● He goes throughMonday— The relationship of pairing and complementarity.
● It widens acrossThe seven— The system is perfect.
● Then he reachesThe Twelve— The group's unity of consciousness.
Just as creation appears to be multiple,
Its essenceUnity manifested in harmonious diversity.
This is the meaning of God Almighty's saying:
"And each [of them] is swimming in an orbit."(The Prophets: 33).
Every number in this universe has an orbit.
But they all revolve around one center —The right.

Large Numbers: From History to Consciousness
When the Quran mentions large numbers —One hundred, one thousand, ten thousand, twelve, seventy... —
It does not present a historical record, but rather depictsMaps of collective consciousness.
Each of these numbers refers toA level of shared human experience:
● The letter (A) symbolizes the long time frame and patience in the message.
● (Seventy) refers to the breadth of forgiveness and the gradual progression in ranks.
● And (the twelve) refers to the organization of the nation in its twelve axes of existence and time.
This makes the large numberA symbol of the collective movement towards God،
Where the ego transcends its limits to enter the divine light network that unites all in one.

End of the entrance
The number here no longer pertains only to the body or time,
but rather collective consciousnessIn his journey towards God:
From the individual self to the conscious nation,
From the individual striving towards a cohesive community,
From calculation to wisdom,
From quantity to meaning, through which all of life is manifested in a harmonious form.
It is as if it is a single number in God's scales.
Just as the word is manifested in the letter,
Likewise, the nation is reflected in its numbers.
The number is manifested in the meaning.
The meaning is only revealed to those who understand the relationship between the individual and the group, between creation and command, between number and truth.


Chapter 11 – The Twelve: The Wellspring of the Community and the Water of Consciousness
A person is not complete alone.
For the soul, however sublime its depth,
You needhuman mirrorIt reflects its light.
ThereforeThe one who journeys to God does not walk alone..
Not because unity is a deficiency,
But becauseMan is a mirror of man.
That's why the number cametwelve
pregnantThe structure of shared human existence.
● twelve monthsTime management
● Twelve springs for MosesWhen the rock explodes
● Twelve leaders among the children of IsraelTo control the group
● Twelve zodiac signsFor the regularity of the movement of the sky
● Twelve paths of awareness and insight circlesAccording to the people of spiritual path
The TwelveNot a number of organizations،
but rather Number of harmony.

From one → to the group
Human beings beginOne.
Then he crossesMonday— Duplication.
Then he ascendsThree, four…
Until it reachesIts internal completenessAt ten o'clock.
Then the question arises:
What next?I؟
Here comesThe Twelve.
It is not the individual's completeness,
but rather The individual's fulfillment within the group.
A group that does not know the one becomes corrupt.
The individual who escapes from the grouppetrified.
The twelve areMeeting place between:
● individual depth
● and the expansion of the nation
● And awareness of the message

Twelve springs: the water only flows if everyone drinks.
When Moses struck the stone with the staff
Not a single spring emerged.
Not five,
but rather twelve.
Each people knows its own drinking place.
The Quran here does not tell of a water miracle,
but rather Miracle of spiritual justice.
that Every soul has its own source.
However
No one is deprived of water.
The group does not mean assimilation.
Nor should everyone become a copy.
Rather, each one should drinkFrom an eye that belongs to him
While the waterFrom a single source.
This is it pure collective consciousness:
Unityoriginally،
And diversityIn the manifestation.

The twelve as an arrangement of human time
Months are not just a calendar.
that it A course in psychology:
AwarenessTime faceStartMuharramRisespringa testJumadaopennessShaabanManifestationRamadansleepDhul-Qa'dahreturnDhul-HijjahEvery year isA complete spiritual journey
It begins, matures, and returns.
as The spirit returns.

The Twelve in the Walking Man
When a person reaches this level
He no longer asks:
● Proof
● No applause
● No agreement
● No acceptance
BecauseHe knew that water was one
And that peopleThey drink according to the capacity of their vessels..
This is peace.

Sign of awareness
Don't look for a group that is similar to you.
Find a groupIt reminds you who you are.
Unity is not about numbers.
but rather At the spring.
He who finds its source
drink.
And whoever drinks
He returned to the peoplewater.


Chapter 12 – Nineteen: The Guardian Number and the Gateway to Discord
It has nineteen
It is not a verse of threat.
but rather A verse of revelation.
When this verse was revealed, hearts were troubled.
The nations said:
“And what about nineteen?!”
Are we incapable of reaching this number?
The Quran responded directly:
And We did not make their number except as a trial.
Strife is not a punishment.
strifemirror.
RevealWhat's inside.
Nineteen is not a scary number,
but rather A number that reveals intentions.

Nineteen = End of the image + Beginning of the unseen
The nine werepeak of fullness.
The ten wereRebirth.
As fornineteen
It is the number that standsBetween the two worlds:
● World of Testimony
● and the unseen world
● The world of the mind
● And the world of signs
● World of Understanding
● And the world of taste
Nineteen isThe door
Which is only opened for those who come
By the weight of the soul, not by the weight of the mind.

Why is nineteen the guardian number?
because The nineIt represents the completion of the picture.
andtenIt represents the return of light to its origin.
Nine plus ten
It means:
Image + Fact
Appearance + Interior
Body + soul
Nineteen is the number that addsThe worlds
Then the spirit asks:
Are you ready to move from plurality to unity?
From knowledge to witnesses?
From faith to certainty?
It's a numberCrossing.

The nineteen as a test of intention
God did not make the numberEasy
Nor is it understandable at first glance.
Because the intention is not understanding.
IntendedWhat are you doing if you don't understand?
There are those who stop and doubt.
And there are those who are arrogant and argumentative.
And there are those who listen… and remain silent… and draw near.
The nineteen tells you:
● Are you here forGod؟
Mother forThe ideaAbout God?
● Do you want the truth؟
A mother wantsPossessing the truth؟
● Did you surrender?
Or is it analysis to stay safe?
In this number
The last vestiges of control are broken.

Campaign of Fire… Campaign of the Throne
The Quran mentions:
● Fire Campaign = Nineteen
● The Throne Campaign = Eight
Why?
because:
Nineteen = Exam
Eight = Access
The nineteenth question the soul:
Are you ready to be extinguished in the light?
So, whovianineteen
EnteredThe eight.
And those who remain will calculate and compare
He remainedOutside the door.

The nineteen in man today
The experience of nineteen is not far off.
It happens whenever:
● I learned what is right
● But something in you feared the consequences.
● or from its price
● Or from your unit after you say: “Yes”
Nineteen isThe moment you see the road clearly
And you know thatCorrect
Then test:
Will you walk?
here
Support won't help you
No advice
There is no evidence.
here
You walk alone.

Sign of awareness
If the road hasn't tested you,
You won't know yourself.
And if you don't pause for a moment at the door
Hesitant
trembling
Exposed
Stripped of all certainty
It will not pass.
Nineteen is not a threat.
It is the honor of the exam.
Who stood firm without running away?
And he breathed despite the confusion
And he said in his heart:
Oh, Lord
The door was opened for him.

Chapter 13 – Forty: Maturity, Retreat, and Return
Forty is not an age.
but rather layer of maturity
A person cannot reach it through age alone.
but rather With experiences brewing inside
Until it is cooked.
That's why the number was repeated.fortyIn the Quran
In moments of great transformation:
● fortyOne day for Moses at the appointed time on Mount Sinai
● fortyA year of wandering for the Israelites
● fortyOne year before the Prophet's mission, may God bless him and grant him peace
● fortyA day for the birth of the heart in the stations of the seekers
Forty isTime of stillness
Where nothing seems to happen
While it burns internallyNew heart.

Forty is not isolation… but rather a disintegration of the image
When Moses ascended the mountain
He didn't go up to escape from the people.
Nor to retreat into poetic silence.
He went up becauseThe soul needs distance
Until she sheds her old image.
In the forties
Things around you don't change.
but rather You changeSo that
You don't see it the way you used to.
Retreat is not withdrawal.
but rather Return to your original source.
And at this depth
Words lose their meaning
And it remainssignalThat's all.

The forties as a time of identity disintegration
In the forties
It disintegrates:
● rulings
● Predictions
● Image of yourself
● The role you were playing
● The questions I thought were final
And it remainsYou are nameless.
That "you" we don't see in the mirror
But inThe same viewing location.
As if the soul were saying:
Before I knew the world
I need to knowWho is looking at him?
Forty isThe moment the observer sees
No perspective.

Forty is a maturity not lived in haste.
No one enters the shrine of the forty
By speeding
Or abbreviation
Or the explanation
Or mind plans.
that it A journey where God cooks your heart over a low flame.
Some maturity doesn't come easily.
With effort
but rather In time.
And some questions go unanswered
Search
but rather Silence.
And some facts are not understood
With reason
but rather Out of modesty.

The forty in man today
She reaches forty when:
● You no longer need to prove yourself
● Nor to convince others
● Nor should it be related to the results.
● Nor to escape loss or pain
You arrive when you understand:
What is written for you will come to pass.
What is not meant for you will not stay at your door even if you knock on it a thousand times.
here
The heart becomeswide enough
For containment
For forgiveness

Sign of awareness
Forty is not a period of time that just passes you by…
but rather You go through it.
Graduate from it
No, not as it came from others.
graduation More peaceful,
Talk less,
Looking deeper,
A more genuine presence.
At the end of the forties,
Don't say, "I understand."
Rather, she says:
I lived there.

Chapter 14 – Seventy: The Balance of Mercy and Choice
The number seventy in the Quran is not meant for counting.
Rather, it comesTo increase mercy.
When God said to His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him:
Even if you were to ask forgiveness for them seventy times, God would never forgive them.
Nothing prevented him from seeking forgiveness.
Rather, it wasThe Prophet's heart expands to the furthest extent of mercy.،
Then he teaches him
that Mercy does not open a door whose owner has refused to enter.
Seventy is not cruelty.
but rather Respect for the freedom of the spirit.
God does not force his way into hearts.
God He is waiting for her signal.

Seventy = Mercy + Freedom of Choice
Compassion is not about giving without limits,
Nor should it be raised without reason.
True mercy is:
● To give from the heart
● Without coercion
● Without waiting
● And without owning
Seventy isMaximum effort
Before giving turns intoCancel the other.
It's a moment when you say:
I have given you all the light I possess.
And if you refuse,
I cannot open the door for you.
Seventy isThe last limit before a person surrenders another to God.

Seventy as a station of spiritual steadfastness
At the shrine of the seventy

Nor gentle
Nor weakness.

And he does not get involved
And grants

Seventy is not a love that melts away.
Rather, it is loveHe stands firm like a mountain.

Seventy in the path of the soul

To love because love is a right.
Not because you need something in return.

Seventy in the Quran: Mercy that is not imposed
When Moses asked to see God,
He was told:
And Moses chose from his people seventy men for Our appointed time.
He did not chooseThe most knowledgeable
no The strongest argument
no Most worshipped.
to choose The hearts that he thought could bear closeness.
But even these
When the light appeared
They trembled
And they fell.
Because closeness requiresA heart that melted before it saw.

Chapter 15 – The Alpha: Extension Beyond Time

The letter Alif in the Quran does not only come as a number,
Rather likeA symbol of gentle eternity،
For the sake ofThe passage of time does not tire him.
Like a thousand years of what you count.
The thousand here is not a calculation.
but rather Distance between two times:
● TimeWe count it in days and hours
● and timeIt is measured by the maturity of the soul and the depth of awareness.
A thousand is not a long time.
but rather Intensive ripening
Until time becomestransparent.

The letter A: the moment time dissolves into meaning
When a person moves in normal time
He grows old.
He grows old.
He is afraid of missing out.
But when he enters the stationthousand
Time does not turn backenemy
And it doesn't remainrestriction
And it does not becomeHe ruled over him.
The letter alif is:
To dwell in the moment
Until it expands
And it becomes all-encompassing.
No past to drag you down
And no future threatens you
And no present will crush you.
nowIt becomes deep
No point.

The letter A in spiritual transformation
The letter 'alif' is not a position that comes after a long effort.
but rather The fruit of complete acceptance.
When the internal conflict stops
When the heart no longer negotiates with God
No guarantees are required.
He does not compromise on the truth.
He cannot escape his reflection in the mirror…
Then
The human entersthousand.
The letter 'alif' is not an arrival.
but rather A stillness in a presence that cannot be explained.

The thousandth is the expanse of mercy
In the place of the letter Alif
People no longer see others as separate individuals.
Rather, he seesOne stream
It takes different forms.
Here he no longer hates anyone.
He fears no one.
He is not harsh on anyone.
Not because people have changed,
Rather, it is because the heart has changed.
He began to seeGod is at work in everything.

The thousandth is a time that does not flow
When God Almighty said about the Night of Decree:
Better than a thousand months
He wasn't offering a comparison.
He was revealing a truth:
● that momentPresenceOne
EqualageFrom ordinary time.
If you truly enter the light
EnoughOne minute
To change your whole life.
The thousand, therefore, is not a length.
but rather Depth.

The letter Alif: The tranquility of the knower after the path is complete
in the thousand
The seeker no longer searches.
It is not explained.
He doesn't argue.
He doesn't share his experience.
It does not require language that embellishes the meaning.
but rather He sits.
He sits as the sea sits at dawn:
quiet
deep
wide
He doesn't need to say anything
because Everything passes through it.

Sign of awareness
Do not ask: How do I reach the level of Alif?
Because the question itself
It is what is hidden from you.
The thousand is not required.
thousandIt comes
When the demand dies down.
When you no longer want to reach [the destination]
But you wantHonesty only.
And when it becomesHonestly
God will open a door for you
Time does not know him
And the clocks don't record it.
In that door
The heart calms
And becomesAs wide as the horizon
and clearLike water that has not yet been touched.

Part Four: Numbers as Spiritual Awareness — From Counting to Witnessing
Introduction to the section
When the linguistic, legislative, and universal understanding of the number is complete,
There remains one dimension that cannot be grasped by the abstract mind.
Rather, it is tasted by the Spirit:witnessing dimension.
The number at its final level is neither a system nor a symbol.
but rather A state of consciousness manifested in the human heart.
Just as letters in their early stages were signals for sounds,
Then words became a means of expressing meaning.
Similarly, numbers at their ends transcend calculation to becomeStations of manifestation.

From counting to mentioning
A person begins counting by taking a tally:
His prayers, his days, his sins, his good deeds...
But when his awareness matures,
He discovers thatCounting was a path to remembering،
The purpose of counting is not the number itself.
Rather, he should mention God in every count, until he forgets the count and only the worshipped remains.
That is why God Almighty said:
“Those who remember God while standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect upon the creation of the heavens and the earth…”(Al-Imran: 191).
The male hereWitness countNo counting in numbers.
It's a transition fromHow much is the male? to How to become aware of God.

Number as a voice of the internal balance
In spiritual ranks, the number becomesRhythm of the soul:
Every movement of remembrance, and every repetition of glorification,
It is a repetition of a sacred number that returns the heart to its original center.
So, reciting the tasbih thirty-three times is not a mere formality.
but rather Adjusting the heart's wave to the frequency of divine balance.
When the believer saysPraise God،
It restores itself to the position where multiplicity harmonizes with unity.
The spirit of balance is alive in this issue.
And in the balance, the face of God is manifested in every breath of remembrance.

Number as a mirror of light
Spiritual awareness sees in numbersLights, not symbols.
So one becomesSunday attendance،
And the twoThe manifestation of the relationship between truth and creation،
And the threeBalance of majesty, beauty, and perfection،
and the sevenThe complete cosmic and spiritual cycles،
As for nine and ten, they areA passage from hardship to ease, and from seeking to witnessing.
When the heart reaches the level of ten,
It opens ontoThe whole eye— The consciousness that sees God in everything,
Counting is no longer necessary, but becomesThe witnesses are the account،
As Ali (may God honor his face) said:
“Work for your afterlife as if you see it.”

From number to forever
The number is limited, but eternity is unlimited.
But God combined them in one verse:
“And indeed, a day with your Lord is like a thousand years of those which you count.”(Al-Hajj: 47).
What bodies count in days,
God prepares itAt the level of light in hearts.
Hence, the jurisprudence of spiritual numbers becomesJurisprudence in the Hidden Time،
Where the minute becomes a station, and the moment becomes a witness.
WhereTime is measured by clarity, not by hours..

Conclusion of the introduction
In this section, we leave the calculation of ranks to their witnesses,
We move from counting phenomena to understanding the lights.
Let's discover thatEvery number in the Quran is a gateway to a station of closeness to God.،
And every repetition of the remembrance is a summoning of a level of light.
From the jurisprudence of numbers as legislation, God worshipped the system.
And from his understanding as a symbol, God witnessed existence.
And from his understanding of spiritual awareness,
He saw in the number only the face of the One and Only God.
Chapter 16 – Numerical Stations in the Journey to God
The number in the Quran is not a method of calculation, butA path to walk.
Each number representsA position in the path of consciousness،
Through it, the seeker progresses from knowing the system to witnessing the organizer.
From looking at numbers to dissolving into the One who cannot be counted.
God Almighty said:
"You will ride one stage after another."(The Splitting: 19).
Any rank after rank, and any level after level,
Numbers are these “layers” that the heart passes through on its journey from multiplicity to unity.

First place: One — the origin of consciousness
Starting fromOneThe first reminder is that all of existence originates from a single source.
And that everything besides Him is but a branch of His light.
The station of the One is the stationIntellectual Unification،
Where the heart begins to separate from the shadows of multiplicity to search for its origin.

Second place: The two — integration and examination
The interaction begins on "Monday".
It is arrangedrelationshipBetween truth and creation, between the self and the spirit, between remembrance and action.
At this point, the seeker learns the meaning of balance.
The law of marriage, which applies to everything, is tested:
"And of everything We created pairs, that you may remember."(Al-Dhariyat: 49).

The third level: The three — the scale of perfection
The number “three” is the first level of perfect balance:
Majesty, beauty, perfection.
It is a placeThe scaleWhere the seeker learns that truth cannot be grasped from one side only.
Rather, it is from the meeting of opposites at the point of justice.
And it is in this context that insight is born, because the third eye isHeart awareness.

The fourth station: The Seven — the perfection of the system and the beginning of the opening
Seven is the number of heavens, the number of the two-folded (verses of the Quran), and the number of gates of Hell.
It is a symbolStructural perfectionIn the universe and the soul.
Whoever reaches the age of "seven" enters the circle of perfection.
But it's not the end, ratherThreshold of conquest،
After structural perfection comes luminous expansion.

The fifth station: The Eight — the expansion of existence and the bearing of light
At “the Eight,” the seeker transcends the limits of the system into the vastness of light.
It is a stagePregnancy:
“And eight [angels] will bear the throne of your Lord above them on that Day.”(Al-Haqqah: 17).
It is a symbol of the forces that raise human consciousness towards the throne.
Where the carrier becomes carried by light,
He learns that expansion can only be achieved by remaining at the center.

The sixth station: The Nine — The Quest for Truth
Nine represents the highest degree of human effort.
It is the end of the cycle of striving before the conquest.
Where the seeker reaches the limits of his ability.
He discovers thatTruth is not attained through toil alone, but through divine revelation..
It is the moment of "the hour" in the existential sense —
The sudden revelation of the truth after the journey is complete.

The seventh station: The Ten — The Dawn of Perfection and Witnesses
Ten is the completion of nine, a moment of balance between effort and grace.
It is a placeWitnesses after the search،
Where the veil is lifted between the servant and his Lord,
He testifies that all the previous numbers and positions were an education for awareness, not a distance in the path.
In this context, multiplicity is transformed into unity.
Each number goes back to its origin: the One and Only.

The final station: what comes after the number — the station of annihilation and subsistence
When the numbers run out, the journey doesn't end.
Rather, it begins with a level that cannot be expressed by number or quantity.
Because the seeker hasIts multiplicity dissolved into the unity of truth..
And here the meaning of God Almighty's saying is realized:
"And that to your Lord is the final destination."(An-Najm: 42).
What comes after the number is the denominator.Abiding in God after annihilation in God،
Where there is neither count nor anything to be counted.
Rather, the servant realizes that every number was a facet of the Oneness.
And that every existence was a utterance of the first letter:Be.

Chapter End
Numerical denominators are not degrees of arithmetic.
but rather rising awareness،
The heart gradually progresses from order to light.
From understanding to taste,
Until complete unification is achieved —
where it becomesEverything is a number from God's vast book.
Whoever starts counting learns order.
And whoever continues on the path learns wisdom.
And whoever concludes with the witnesses realizes that all numbers are one face of the One and Only God.


Chapter 17 – The Hour: The Moment of Great Revelation

From time to reality
The Quran repeatedly mentions the “Hour” in many places,
But it's not always "the end of time",
but rather The moment meaning is revealed after being hidden،
The moment when a person encounters the truth of what he believed to be unseen.
They ask you about the Hour, when will it occur?(Al-A’raf: 187).
They did not ask about its time in vain.
But because they realized — without fully realizing —
That "the Hour" is not a distant event, butA state of consciousness will come suddenly،
As God Almighty said:
“The Hour is coming, I almost conceal it, so that every soul may be recompensed for what it strives for.”(Taha: 15).
It is coming in time.
But itSpeak in consciousnessBefore you fall into the universe.

The clock between counting and awareness
The word "clock" in Arabic comes from the rootQ and A،
It is a root that indicatesSpaciousness and openness after constriction.
From this root came the words:Capacity, range, nine...
Therefore, the hour is not a moment of cosmic closure, butcomprehensive openness —
Broadening of vision, and unveiling of the truth.
Just as vision expands at the end of the numerical cycle.
This is why it is associated in the Quran with astonishment and surprise:
"Do they then await anything but the Hour, that it should come upon them suddenly while they do not perceive it?"(Al-Zukhruf: 66).
The time here isThe moment the veil between quantity and quality is lifted,
Between time and eternity.

From counting to exposure
Every number in the book — from one to ten, and from seven to eight —
he A journey towards the moment of revelation.
Numbers teach us order, and scales teach us balance.
But the hour is a momentDirect visionFor the system itself.
It is the turning point from “counting things” to “seeing meaning in everything.”
she The end of the reckoning and the beginning of the witnesses.
This is why some Sufi commentators said:
"He who knows his hour, his resurrection has come."
That is, whoever has the face of God revealed to him in a moment of awareness.
He tasted the hour before it arrived.

The hour as a cosmic and internal transformation
The Quran portrays the “Hour” as a great cosmic event,
But consider how he links it to the internal transformation within man:
“When the sun is folded up, and when the stars are dimmed…”(Spheres: 1–2).
The sun and stars appear to be planets.
But the underlying meaning isSources of light in the soul:
When the fake lights inside go out,
The sun of truth rises and never sets.
From the perspective of Quranic consciousness, the hour
It is a momentchanging lights:
The fall of the light of time, and the birth of the light of eternity.
The counting of days has ended, and the realization of eternity has begun.

I almost hide it
One of the deepest secrets of the verse:
"The Hour is coming, I almost conceal it..."
It is as if God Almighty is saying:
She's so close I almost hid herIn you.
Every person carries their "clock" in their heart.
When his awareness is complete and the veil is lifted,
His minor resurrection takes place — the moment of witnessing, not death.
It's a moment of combiningHard work and responsibilityandPlease and exposure:
● Toil: Because reaching awareness requires effort and patience.
● Please: because revelation is only attained through divine grace.
Thus, the clock balances betweentoil and secrecy،
Just as creation balances effort and grace.

The Great Hour: The Unveiling of Collective Consciousness
If the “individual hour” is the moment of witnessing the truth within oneself,
The “great hour” is a momentUnveiling the cosmic consciousness of all humanity.
At that point, nations are not measured by their numbers.
Rather, by its light.
A person is not judged solely by their deeds.
Rather, it depends on how truthful he is with the truth.
It's an hourUncovering the collective،
Where all of creation understands the meaning of God Almighty's words:
“You were heedless of this, but We have removed your veil, so your sight today is sharp.”(Q:22).

From number to forever
All of the above, in terms of the number of positions, was in preparation for this moment.
The One taught us the origin.
Both of them taught us about the relationship.
And the seven taught us order.
And ten taught us perfection.
But “the clock” teaches usThe entire system is a means of exposure..
Numbers were a ladder towards understanding.
The clock is the point whereThe ladder breaks in the light،
Neither number nor time remains.
Rather, it is the eternal presence in the face of the One.

Chapter End
“The clock” is the last mirror in which consciousness reflects the image of truth.
she The end of counting and the beginning of eternity.
she The present rises from the ruins of absence.
If the Hour has come in the heart,
Life is no longer about waiting.
Rather, it became a constant encounter with God at every moment.
It's a momentThe Great Exposure،
Where the truth behind the numbers is revealed.
Each number then returns to its source.
And all time melts into eternity.
And God's promise is fulfilled:
"And that to your Lord is the final destination.".
Chapter 18 – Conclusion: Man as a Mirror of the Scales

Man as a mirror of the scales: from counting to witnessing
Continuing our contemplative journey into the world of Quranic numbers, which distinguished between "number" as a quantity and "figure" as a quality, we arrive at a crucial point where this vision is manifested:Man as a mirror of the divine balanceThis concept takes us from merely "counting" phenomena and signs to the level of "witnessing" truths and manifestations, where man is no longer just a being in the universe, but becomes himself a scale by which values ​​are known and wisdom is manifested.
The balance in the Quran: justice, law, and cosmic order
The concept of "balance" in the Holy Quran is not limited to the physical weighing instrument, but extends to encompass deeper and more comprehensive meanings. The balance is justice and equity upon which the heavens and the earth were established; it is the divine law that preserves the universe's equilibrium and harmony. God Almighty says: "And the heaven He raised and established the balance. That you not transgress within the balance. And establish weight with justice and do not fall short in the balance." (Ar-Rahman: -) Messengers were sent and scriptures were revealed to establish this balance among people: {We have already sent Our messengers with clear proofs and revealed with them the Scripture and the balance so that mankind may establish justice} (Al-Hadid: 15). Thus, the balance is a universal law, a moral value, and a standard for judgment in the Hereafter.
Man: The speaking scale and the microcosm
If the universe is the silent scale, then humankind is the speaking scale. Humans were created in the best of forms, appointed as stewards of the earth, and endowed with reason and the ability to distinguish between right and wrong. This unique constitution makes humankind a microcosm of the universe, reflecting its laws and balances. Just as numbers in the Quran have qualitative significance describing the nature of creation and legislation, they also describe the nature of humankind and its inner equilibrium.
● The balance of creation and formation:The Qur’an describes the creation of man in “three darknesses,” not as a simple count of three layers, but as a description of how creation occurs in a complex and multifaceted environment, preserved by a precise divine power, reflecting the balance of craftsmanship and creativity in the origin of man’s formation.
● Balance of awareness and responsibility:The interpretation of the eight "bearers of the throne" as representing the fundamental functions of the human brain, as presented in the series, offers a profound insight into humanity as a responsible being. The throne here symbolizes the center of control and sovereignty within the human entity, and its eight bearers represent the pillars of consciousness, perception, and responsibility. The number "eight" here is not meant to be counted, but rather to describe the structure of this internal balance within humanity.
● The balance of legislation and behavior:The numbers in the laws relating to adultery (one hundred lashes) and slander (eighty lashes) are not to be understood merely as quantitative measures, but as qualitative standards aimed at restoring social equilibrium. Each punishment is proportionate to the extent of the disruption the act has caused to the balance of society, and aims at reform, deterrence, and restoring equilibrium.
From counting (negligence) to witnessing (vigilance)
The spiritual ascent of man is a journey from "counting" to "witnessing".
● Counting stage:At this stage, man is immersed in a world of quantities and appearances. He counts blessings without seeing the Giver of blessings, and enumerates creatures without witnessing the magnificence of the Creator. He treats numbers as inanimate quantities and life as separate, material facts. This is the state of heedlessness in which man may live, seeing the signs but failing to perceive them.
● Rank of witnesses:As for witnessing, it is the perception of God's greatness in His creation. It is a state of annihilation of the self through witnessing the Truth, where the mystic no longer sees things as independent entities, but rather as manifestations of the One Truth. At this level, numbers are transformed from mere numerals into symbols and attributes signifying the divine order. The numbers "one" and "Ahad" are no longer the beginning of counting, but become witnesses to the divine singularity and oneness. And "seven heavens" are no longer simply numbers, but witnesses to a perfectly ordered, layered cosmic structure.
When a person reaches this level, they themselves become a "mirror of the scales." Their heart becomes a scale by which they weigh matters with justice, their consciousness becomes a mirror reflecting the wisdom of creation, and their conduct becomes a reflection of the justice and order upon which the heavens and the earth were established. In doing so, they fulfill the purpose for which the Book and the scales were revealed: that people may uphold justice, not only in their dealings but also in the depths of their being and their perception of God.



The Grand Conclusion of the Book
The Circle Returns to Its Center

In the beginning, there was not "number," but "the Letter."
The primordial Discourse was the eternal command "Be!"—and existence sprang forth from a single, luminous center. The Letter was the manifestation of Divine Essence, and the Word was the very breath of existence, prior to all reckoning. From this center, the circle of creation began its expansion.

Yet, lest this Discourse be lost in a formless void, it required a Balance. Thus, number emerged as the measure by which God structures the Word—it is the inherent architecture of all creation. As we have seen, it is "the manifestation of order within the word."

In this book, we have traversed the circumference of this great circle. We began our journey from the apparent world of quantity to the hidden realm of quality. We followed number in its primary role as a law that organizes human life and regulates the rhythm of worship, in harmony with the balance of existence. Then, we ascended to perceive it as a cosmic symbol, revealing the layers of creation and the architecture of the heavens—from the "One" to the "Two," from the perfection of "Seven" to the vastness of "Eight."

Yet, a circle is completed not by expansion alone, but by its return.

The journey necessarily turned inward, from counting to witnessing. On the final leg of our path, number transformed from a system to be tallied into a spiritual consciousness to be directly experienced. We discovered that numbers were never the destination, but rather waystations—a ladder of ascending awareness by which we climb toward the Origin.

Here, at the peak of consciousness, we reach the point where counting dissolves, and all multiplicity vanishes in the presence of the One.

This is the Hour.

The Hour is not merely the end of time, but the great moment of revelation we were promised. It is the instant when the veil is lifted, and the Discourse (the first Letter) converges with the Balance (the numerical order) in a single, unified witness. It is the moment when calculation ceases, and eternity begins.

In the Hour, we realize that quantity was but a shadow, and quality was the substance. We see how humanity is the mirror upon which the letters are inscribed and by which all things are measured, so that we might ourselves uphold the Balance of existence.

And so, the circuit is closed.

The consciousness that began its journey from the "Letter" ("Be!"), and passed through the realm of "Number" (in both creation and divine law), returns in "the Hour" (the state of direct witnessing) to behold the first "Letter" at the center of all things.

This journey of "Understanding Numbers" was, in its essence, a journey from "Discourse" to "Balance," from "Balance" to "Humanity," and from "Humanity" to the direct witnessing of "The Lord of All the Worlds."

For whoever comprehends the Letter begins to articulate true expression.
Whoever comprehends Number grasps the principle of Balance.
And whoever comprehends Consciousness returns to the Center—where there is no letter, no number, nothing remains but the Face of the One, the Unique God.



 THANKS, APPRECIATION, AND DEDICATION TO THE READERS OF AL-BASAIR
Acknowledgment and appreciation: To everyone who lit a candle on the path of contemplation
In conclusion of this humble effort, I extend my sincere thanks to everyone who contributed to enriching this work on reflecting upon the Holy Quran, inspired by the divine call:Do they not then reflect upon the Qur'an?(Women: 82), and it is the motivation for every effort made in this book.
● Gratitude illuminates the paths:Praise be to God, who made wisdom the lost treasure of the believer, and brought us together with those who remind us of His signs. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who lit a candle on the path of this endeavor, making contemplation a bridge between hearts and minds.
● To those firmly grounded in knowledge:Great men stood like mountains in a time of confusion, and God blessed me with the abundance of their knowledge and the purity of their hearts, especially those who linked the depth of interpretation with the concerns of reality, and they were the best heirs of the prophets.
● To newcomers to contemplation:Young people and scholars have made the Quran a living dialogue, not merely adhering to its literal meaning, but delving into its secrets and opening windows we never knew existed. Thanks to those who insisted that the Quran be a book of life, not just a book on a shelf.
● To every participant with sincere intentions:Whether Muslim or non-Muslim, agreeing or disagreeing, every letter written with the intention of seeking the truth is a struggle in the path of God, and every constructive criticism was a mirror that illuminated the flaws of the work.
● Special thanks:For those who believe that the Qur’an is renewed by the contemplation of its people, they supported this project with their opinions and their time, and reminded us that “the best of people are those who are most beneficial to people.”

Dedicated to the discerning reader: The duty of reflection and the responsibility of insight
I dedicate this work to every reader seeking guidance and spiritual connection with the Creator, and to every soul striving for purification through the gateway of the Quran. These reflections, as previously emphasized in the book itself, arePurely human effortIt is an attempt to navigate into the depthsQuranic InsightsWhich unfolds in layers, and its perception differs from one observer to another.
● The reality of human contemplation:This effort, like all human endeavors,It is subject to both error and correctness., Follow the cleansing of the sight of the wise and what Allah has opened to it. Our thoughts are nothing but the sight of change and evolution according to the sight of our Lord Sincerity and strength of demand.
● Between guidance and misguidance:The Quran guides and misleads, and only those who are purified and strive to purify and refine their souls can grasp its inner meaning.Superficial reading and limited materialistic interpretationThey are sources of error, and no one who is immoral, unjust, or ungrateful for the principle of God’s universal transcendence will benefit from them, as stated in this book of ours.
● Reflection is a collective effort:I remind you that the true understanding of the esoteric meanings of the Quran isCollective collective workIt is not merely a sacred, individual idea. Therefore, II absolve myselfBefore God and before you, fromsanctificationThese ideas, or the notion of them as absolute truths that are beyond criticism and debate,“Everyone’s words are subject to acceptance or rejection, except for the one who is buried in this grave.”(Referring to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him).
● Our approach to reading:I invite you to use this book as aA key to your own reflectionAnd presenting what is in it to the scales of Sharia, sound reason, and pure instinct, so that together we may achieve the Qur’anic approach:Those who listen to the word and follow the best of it - those are the ones whom Allah has guided, and those are the ones endowed with understanding.(Al-Zumar: 18).
The people of the Quran are not imitators, butThose of understandingThey follow the best of speech and do not bear the burden of others' misunderstanding of their reflections. So let us reflect together, and let us fear God so that He may teach us and make our work purely for His noble countenance.

 CONCEPTUAL INDEX (GLOSSARY) OF THE BOOK
Conceptual Index (Glossary) of the Book
The termDefinition/Significance in the context of the bookNumber (quantitative)Number as a unit of calculation for measuring quantities and counting (such as days of fasting, number of rak'ahs). It is the apparent level.The (qualitative) numberNumber, as a symbol that carries existential and spiritual significance, refers to a cosmic order or a level of consciousness (such as "seven heavens" as a symbol of perfection).StatementThe visible aspect of divine wisdom, manifested in the letter, word, and apparent meaning of the Qur’anic discourse.The scaleDivine law and the precise order that governs creation and legislation. It is the balanced and measured aspect of existence, revealed by number.numerical awarenessElevating the view of numbers from mere counting and enumeration to the level of contemplating their meaning and witnessing their order expands human understanding of existence.Jurisprudence of NumbersThe science that combines linguistic and contextual analysis with existential reflection to understand the significance of numbers in the Qur’an, in an effort to understand the balance between the legal and cosmic order.SundayThe absolute truth that precedes all counting, and admits neither repetition nor division. It represents the station of witnessing and annihilation in the divine presence.OneThe principle of counting and the origin of multiplicity. It represents the beginning of recognizing God through the system of creation.Legislative (number)The dimension by which God organizes human affairs, worship, and human relations (such as inheritance and the waiting period).Formative (number)The dimension by which God organizes the movement of existence itself (such as the creation of the heavens and the earth in six days).DuplicationThe universal law of integration between opposites (male and female, night and day), which is based on balance and not conflict.The threeIt symbolizes the establishment and balance of the structure (spirit, soul, body). It represents the first level of perfect equilibrium and initial perfection.The sevenThe symbol of perfection and the complete cycle in the cosmic and spiritual system (heavens, days, signs).The eightIt symbolizes expansion and openness after completion. It represents the forces that support the throne (the center of existence) and the station of giving and abundance.The nineThe threshold or edge that precedes the great revelation. It represents the completion of the inner readiness for transformation and rebirth.tenA symbol of completeness and perfection that restores light to its origin. It represents the transition from seeking to witnessing, and beginning anew with a discerning eye.The TwelveA symbol of harmony and group organization around a single axis while maintaining the distinctiveness of individuals (such as tribes and months).nineteenThe number "Guardian" represents the test of intention and the passage from the world of the seen to the world of the unseen. It is a mirror that reveals what is inside.FortyA symbol of maturity, seclusion, and the time of internal fermentation necessary for fundamental transformation and return to the original source.seventyIt symbolizes the vastness of mercy coupled with respect for freedom of choice. It represents the ultimate extent of human giving before surrendering to God.thousandThe symbol of extension outside of time, and the moment when time dissolves into meaning, so that man enters into "soft eternity".the hourThe moment of great revelation in individual or collective consciousness, when the veil between quantity and quality disappears, and the divine order is revealed in itself.WitnessesThe ultimate goal of the journey, where counting becomes a direct observation of the truth, and there is no more number or time, but rather a presence in the face of the One and Only God.Man (as a mirror of the scales)The being that combines within itself “statement” (language and consciousness) and “balance” (numerical system), to be a tool for knowing the divine balance in existence.


References and Sources - Threads of Thought that Wove this Work

 Introduction: Standing at the Threshold of Gratitude

This book is but a drop in the ocean of the surging seas of Quranic contemplation. Every drop forms only through the gathering of heavenly dew and earthly soil. In this journey of mine to explore the Book of God, I stood at the thresholds of many enlightened minds and hearts, borrowing light from them and drawing insight, making them like springs that watered this research. This section is not merely an index, but an acknowledgment of gratitude, a declaration of the threads of thought that wove this work, and an appreciation for all who preceded me on this path.

About the Author: The Journey in Search of the Code

Nasser bin Dawood

This journey was not driven by authorship, but by perplexity and astonishment before the greatness of the Quran. Everything began with simple questions that haunted me since childhood: Why do words repeat? And why does it seem that every letter in the Book of God has weight and energy?

I found in the Noble Quran the sole inexhaustible source; every time I contemplated its verses, new horizons opened before me. Then I found in the Arabic language, indeed in the code of its primary letters (as in "dam" = d + m), the key that opened doors for me to understand the relationship between the word and the meaning, between matter and spirit.

Then my eyes opened to the signs of the universe in the earth and the sky. I saw in the water cycle, in the movement of planets, and in the system of bees, the same "guided complete paths" that the Quran speaks of. I realized that the Quran is not just a book to be read, but a "code" to be lived and seen everywhere.

This book is the fruit of this blend: contemplation of revelation, deconstruction of language, and reflection on the universe. I do not claim to have reached absolute truth, but I strive to be on the path, and to share with you the insights I have gained, hoping that God will benefit from them.
Nasser Ibn Dawood Library: A Renewing Project from Printed Code to Artificial Intelligence

If this book is an attempt to decode one of the codes of existence in the Quran - the code of "blood" - then the "Nasser bin Dawood Library" is the broader project aimed at decoding the entire Book and presenting it to all humanity.

Stemming from a firm conviction that contemplation is a collective journey that is only complete through sharing, and that the light of knowledge must illuminate everyone without monopoly, the idea of the "Nasser bin Dawood Library" was born as a natural extension of this book, and as a scientific beacon overlooking the world, spreading its heritage through an "Open Knowledge" system for all.

Our Vision: Building a comprehensive digital ecosystem that combines the authenticity of heritage with the modernity of technology, to be a free global reference for every seeker of truth in the Book of God and in the signs of the universe.
