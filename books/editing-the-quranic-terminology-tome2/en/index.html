        <h3>Volume 1 Description: Theoretical and Methodological Foundation</h3>
        <p>Volume 1 serves as the cornerstone and methodological gateway to the entire "Clarifying Qur'anic Terminology" project. The author dedicates this part to establishing the intellectual and textual tools that will be used in subsequent volumes, providing readers with a clear roadmap to understanding the Qur'an through its own framework.</p>
        
        <p>This volume primarily aims to build a new framework for contemplation (tadabbur), transitioning readers from traditional reception to direct analysis of the Qur'anic text in its original form. It represents an intellectual and methodological "rehabilitation" process that deconstructs traditional foundations of understanding and replaces them with new foundations based on the original Qur'anic text and its internal rules.</p>
        
        <h4>Main Themes of Volume 1:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rooting Sources and Methodology:</strong> Returning to original Qur'anic manuscripts, diagnosing current understanding crises, and establishing "Fiqh al-Lisan al-Qur'ani" methodology</li>
            <li><strong>Reconstructing Doctrinal and Worship Concepts:</strong> Rereading fundamental Islamic concepts like prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, and glorification</li>
            <li><strong>Faith and Existential Concepts:</strong> Understanding the self, Paradise and Hell, Night of Decree (Laylat al-Qadr), and faith between text and interpretation</li>
            <li><strong>Knowing Allah:</strong> Presenting specialized series on understanding Lordship (Rububiyyah) and Divinity (Uluhiyyah)</li>
            <li><strong>Methodology for Handling Heritage:</strong> Critical approach to Prophetic traditions and evaluating narrations against the Qur'an</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Volume 2 Description: Practical Applications and Advanced Analysis</h3>
        <p>The second volume of this encyclopedic work represents the transition from methodological theorization to intensive practical application of "Qur'anic Language Jurisprudence." After establishing theoretical foundations in Volume 1, this volume delves into core issues and concepts that have shaped Muslim understanding of the Qur'anic text throughout history, offering a renewing vision to deconstruct terms and reconstruct them according to the book's methodology based on the principle that the Qur'an explains itself.</p>
        
        <p>This volume focuses on addressing a wide range of pivotal Qur'anic concepts and terms that have often been sources of controversy or misunderstanding. Serving as an applied workshop, the author takes readers on a journey through Qur'anic verses and terms, demonstrating how "Fiqh al-Lisan al-Qur'ani" methodology can produce different, more authentic, and deeper understanding of religious and life concepts, calling for liberation from inherited interpretations and direct return to the "Clear Light" and "Clear Arabic Tongue" in which the Qur'an was revealed.</p>
        
        <h4>Main Themes of Volume 2:</h4>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Re-reading Terms Related to Rulings and Punishments:</strong> Series "Darb in the Qur'an", Killing, Coercion and Taghut, Flogging and Amputation, Concepts of Halal and Haram</li>
            <li><strong>Contemplating Stories and Prophets:</strong> Surah Yusuf, Moses in the Qur'an, Names of Prophets, Sacrifice and Ransom</li>
            <li><strong>Deep Terminological and Linguistic Studies:</strong> Numbers in the Qur'an, Remembrance and Supplication, "Al-Kitab" and "Al-Kutub", "Al-Qur'an", "The Straight Path"</li>
