            <h2>About This Book</h2>
         <p> What is this project?
It's not just a project to digitize old texts; it is:
•	An Invitation: To rediscover the Holy Qur'an, and to interact with it personally and deeply.
•	A Journey: To return to the roots, to the Qur'anic text in its form closest to the moment of revelation.
•	A Bridge: Linking the past and the present, and between tradition and modernity.
•	A Tool: To enable every Muslim to understand the Book of their Lord, contemplate its verses, and apply them in their life.
•	A Community: To build a global network of contemplators and researchers, working together to serve the Book of God.
Why the original manuscripts?
Because they are:
•	The Living Witness: To the Qur'anic text as it was revealed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
•	Living Memory: For God's Book through the centuries.
•	A Hidden Treasure: Which carries with it secrets and meanings that we may not find in printed Qur'ans.
•	A Key: For a deeper and more accurate understanding of the Holy Qur'an.
And what is the series of five books?
It is "The Light of Reason and Authentic Contemplation," and it is not just a theoretical study, but a practical guide that accompanies you step by step in the journey of contemplation, and offers you the following books:
1.	"Anwar al-Bayan fi drawing the Ottoman Qur'an": To know the secrets of Qur'anic script.
2.	"New Rules for the Arabic Qur'anic Tongue": To discover how the language of the Qur'an is built from within.
3.	"Contemplation in the Mirror of Drawings": Learn how to use digital manuscripts for contemplation.
4.	"New Concepts and Interactive Contemplation": Connect the Qur'an to your reality, and make it a source of inspiration for your life.
5.	Digitization of the original manuscripts of the Holy Qur'an: This book presents an ambitious project for the digitization of the original Qur'anic manuscripts.
