The Light of Reason and Authentic Contemplation: Towards a Digital Qur'anic Renaissance
"Read in the name of your Lord who created" [Al-Alaq: 1]
With this great word, the journey of revelation began, and the light of the Holy Qur'an started to illuminate the paths of guidance for humanity. From that moment on, Muslims have recited the Book of their Lord, pondered its verses, and were inspired by its meanings to build their lives and glorify their civilization.
But have you ever asked yourself: Did the glow of contemplation remain as radiant as it was in the first generations? Have we kept the flame of understanding burning through the centuries? Or has the dust of tradition, the clouds of superficial reading, and the obscuration of stereotypical understanding, obscured some of the light of the Qur'an?
In our age, the age of digitization and technology, where everything changes and evolves, we must ask: how can we renew our relationship with the Book of God? How can we restore to contemplation its rightful place in our lives? How can we make the Holy Qur'an the spring of our hearts, the light of our minds, and the guide of our lives, as it was for our ancestors?
Herein lies hope.
From the heart of this question, and from the core of this challenge, the "Digitization of Original Qur'anic Manuscripts" project is launched, offering us a new vision, an innovative methodology, and effective tools to revive authentic contemplation in the digital age.
What is this project?
It's not just a project to digitize old texts; it is:
• An Invitation: To rediscover the Holy Qur'an, and to interact with it personally and deeply.
• A Journey: To return to the roots, to the Qur'anic text in its form closest to the moment of revelation.
• A Bridge: Linking the past and the present, and between tradition and modernity.
• A Tool: To enable every Muslim to understand the Book of their Lord, contemplate its verses, and apply them in their life.
• A Community: To build a global network of contemplators and researchers, working together to serve the Book of God.
Why the original manuscripts?
Because they are:
• The Living Witness: To the Qur'anic text as it was revealed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
• Living Memory: For God's Book through the centuries.
• A Hidden Treasure: Which carries with it secrets and meanings that we may not find in printed Qur'ans.
• A Key: For a deeper and more accurate understanding of the Holy Qur'an.
And what is the series of five books?
It is "The Light of Reason and Authentic Contemplation," and it is not just a theoretical study, but a practical guide that accompanies you step by step in the journey of contemplation, and offers you the following books:
1. "Anwar al-Bayan fi drawing the Ottoman Qur'an": To know the secrets of Qur'anic script.
2. "New Rules for the Arabic Qur'anic Tongue": To discover how the language of the Qur'an is built from within.
3. "Contemplation in the Mirror of Drawings": Learn how to use digital manuscripts for contemplation.
4. "New Concepts and Interactive Contemplation": Connect the Qur'an to your reality, and make it a source of inspiration for your life.
5. Digitization of the original manuscripts of the Holy Qur'an: This book presents an ambitious project for the digitization of the original Qur'anic manuscripts.
This book... It's you!
This book is not just an introduction to a project, but an invitation to you, my brother reader, my sister reader, to be part of this digital Qur'anic renaissance. It is an invitation to you to:
• Contemplate: The Book of God with an open mind and a humbled heart.
• Discover: The treasures of the Qur'an for yourself.
• Share: Your insights with others.
• Build: Your future and the future of your nation on the guidance of the Qur'an.
Let us begin together this blessed journey, and let us make this digital age a golden age of Qur'anic contemplation!


2. Introduction to the initiation of digitizing the original manuscripts of the Noble Qur'an and the Six Book Series: The Light of Reason and Authentic Contemplation
"The Qur'an is guidance, healing, sustenance and light for the believers", with these great words God describes his dear book, stressing that it is the great blessing that guides hearts, heals chests, and illuminates paths. The scholars of the Ummah have made strenuous efforts over the centuries to memorize this great book and facilitate its understanding, setting the formation and points and establishing the rules of recitation. However, these blessed efforts, to the extent that they facilitated the outward reading, inadvertently obscured some of the beauty and contemplative depth of the authentic Qur'anic text. 
In this context, the project of digitizing the original manuscripts of the Holy Qur'an is a unique initiative, which aims to make the Qur'anic text available in its form closer to the moment of revelation, before adding touches of human diligence to it. The digitization of these manuscripts, especially the Ottoman Qur'an, is not merely a work of art, but a call to revive authentic reflection and to encourage critical thinking that transcends blind imitation.
Why are digital manuscripts key to authentic reflection?
• Going beyond "unconscious delivery": digital manuscripts, with their different drawings and composition, reveal to us that the original Qur'anic text was too broad to be reduced to a single reading or stereotyped understanding. It is an invitation to examine legacies with a close eye and not with a surrender eye.
• Freeing the mind from constraints: The Qur'ans in circulation today, with their unified composition, may make the reader feel "complete understanding" and "finality of interpretation". Digital manuscripts, with their different drawings, free the mind from these constraints and open up horizons for questioning and reflection.
• Rediscovering hidden meanings: Going back to the original manuscripts can reveal subtle differences in painting, but these differences may carry with them deeper and finer meanings, beyond superficial and direct meanings.
• Encouraging personal reflection: digitizing manuscripts and transforming them into an interactive book that puts in the hands of each contemplative his own manuscript, shapes words according to his understanding, records his reflections, and shares them with others. Each contemplative person has his own manuscript, which enriches the field of Qur'anic reflection with multiple visions and understandings.
The Six Book Series: From Symbol to Reality 
This six-book series  is not just a theoretical study, but a practical application of the digitization project. Each book in the series presents a different aspect of reflection through digital manuscripts, moving us from symbol to reality, from theory to application.
• The first book: " Anwar al-Bayan: Unveiling the Secrets of Language through the Uthmanic Qur'anic Script " focuses on the linguistic and rhetorical aspects inherent in drawing the Ottoman Qur'an, and opens up prospects for a deeper and more accurate understanding of the Holy Qur'an.
• Book Two: " The Jurisprudence of the Qur'anic Tongue: A New Approach to Understanding the Text and Manuscript " New Rules for the Qur'anic Arabic Tongue: We are not satisfied with traditional grammatical and morphological rules, but we seek to derive new rules, derived from the Qur'anic text itself, using the original Qur'anic manuscripts as a witness to the manifestations of this tongue.
• The third book, " CONTEMPLATION IN THE MIRROR OF SCRIPTS: PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF DIGITAL MANUSCRIPTS IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE QUR'AN " provides practical and concrete applications of how to use digital manuscripts to understand the Holy Qur'an more deeply and comprehensively. 
• Book Four: " NEW CONCEPTS IN QUR'ANIC TERMINOLOGY AND INTERACTIVE CONTEMPLATION: THE QUR'AN IN THE AGE OF DIGITIZATION AND DIGITAL MANUSCRIPTS" This book aims to reconstruct the correct understanding of religion and life by introducing a series of new concepts that span different areas of life: Here is the cover of the book I requested, "Anwar al-Bayan fi Drawing the Ottoman Qur'an: Revealing the Secrets of the Tongue", is on its way to you! I hope it reflects the spirit and content in a way that suits your expectations. Religious, intellectual, social, and economic. It also encourages the use of modern technology, group interaction and digital knowledge collaboration.
• Book Five: The project of digitizing the original manuscripts of the Holy Quran The book presents an ambitious project to digitize the original Qur'anic manuscripts (especially the Ottoman Qur'an) and make them available to the public interactively. The project aims to revive the authentic reflection of the Holy Quran.
• Book Six Towards Conscious Contemplation: A Practical Guide to Understanding and Applying the Noble Qur'an in the Modern Era: 
Call to action:
These six books are a call to action, a call to optimism, and a call to participate in building a better future for Qur'anic reflection and for serving the dear book of God. Let us make
these digital manuscripts the starting point for a rich contemplative journey, in which we draw from the help of the pure Qur'an, draw inspiration from its clear gifts, and discover for ourselves the miracle of the Arabic tongue that was manifested in this eternal book.

3. Passages from the digital manuscript of the Noble Qur'an attributed to Othman bin Affan - Cairo version in the process of completion






(3)"Believe in the unseen": believing in the esoteric meanings of verses that appear only through deep reflection, not just belief in traditional metaphysical things.
"They pray": contacting God by contemplating His signs, and contacting people by communicating these meanings that have been reached.
"From what we have provided them to spend": spreading and promoting the esoteric meanings that were understood through contemplation (from "tunnel": Raj al-Sha'im), and sharing them with others, as the verses need to be explained and clarified.The main idea: Understanding the Qur'an requires deep reflection and great effort ("pain") to reveal the esoteric and coded meanings of the verses ("those books"), and this understanding is guidance for the pious ("guidance for the pious"), those who believe in the unseen ("believe in the unseen"), communicate with God and people ("pray"), and spread these meanings ("from what we have provided them spend").



 Purified, and they are immortalized in it 25 God is not ashamed to set an example with a stick and above it: but those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord, but those who disbelieve will say, What God has willed by this example, that he will lead him astray a lot, and guide him a lot, and what leads him astray except the wicked. 26 Those who break God's covenant after his covenant, and cut off what God commanded him to deliver. 
(26)1. Traditional/famous interpretation: God does not refrain from proverbing any creature, no matter how small (like a mosquito), to signify his power. "Above" means what is larger or smaller than a mosquito. The goal is to show God's power and respond to the deniers of the Qur'an.
2. New (proposed) interpretation:
o It is not ashamed": it is not interpreted in the sense of known modesty, but in the sense of revival, that is, the revival of truth and the revival of falsehood. God revives the truth by revealing and revealing it, and revives falsehood by declaring its invalidity and revealing its falsity.
o The root of the word "Bawsa" goes back to the verb "Baas", which in Arabic means turmoil and instability.
o "Baoussa": It is interpreted in the sense of confusion in the understanding of Qur'anic verses and the lack of access to a logical and straight interpretation, especially in verses that are believed to contain insults or insults to humans.
o "Above": refers to the exacerbation and increase of this disorder due to erroneous interpretations and misleading interpretations that are based on a disturbed understanding of the verse.
o This interpretation links the verse to another verse: "The most important of them divide the mercy of your Lord, we divided among them their living in this worldly life, and we exalted them above each other degrees to take one another as a mockery" (Ornament: 32), to indicate that the disparity between people in understanding and perception is part of God's wisdom in His creation.




(27)1. Criticism of traditional interpretations:
o This interpretation accuses some traditional interpretations and hadiths of distorting the meanings of the Qur'an, distorting them from their correct intentions, leading to false accusations of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and harming people's lives.
o He considers these false interpretations to be part of the "temptation of God" that leads the wicked, that is, those who deviate from the path of truth and correct contemplation.
2. The importance of reflection:
o This interpretation emphasizes that true believers understand that Baousa refers to the truth and the need for deep reflection on the verses of the Qur'an, and that the solution to the disorder of understanding can only come through this reflection.
o On the other hand, infidels or immoral people reject this understanding, and consider the use of the word a lack of politeness or mockery, without realizing its true purpose.
3. God's Covenant and Corruption on Earth:
o "Those who break God's covenant" are interpreted as those who break the link between the true and inner meanings of the Qur'an and people, leading to corruption in the "land" (meaning land and contemplation), not the material "land."
o It links lack of foresight to the spread of suspicion and a misunderstanding of the Qur'an, which makes these "losers" in this world and the hereafter.(28)How do you cover the truth when you were dead souls and hearts, not bodies? So I greet you with the Qur'an because it is a light from God that revives the hearts that were dead of feelings and belief, then kills you, meaning the death of the body, then revives you on the Day of Resurrection for reckoning, then to Him you will return (29)



By praise thee and sanctify thee, he said, I know what ye do not know, 30 And Adam taught all the names, and then he offered them to the king, and he said, Prophyuni in the name of these people, if ye are truthful, 31 They said, Praise thee, we know not except that which thou hast taught us, that thou art the All-Knowing, the Wise. 32 Adam, said, I will tell them by the name of their name, and when I warn them by their names, he said, Did I not tell you, I know the absence of heaven and earth, and I know what you seem, and ye were not secret? 33 


By praise thee and sanctify thee, he said, I know what ye do not know, 30 And Adam taught all the names, and then he offered them to the king, and he said, Prophyuni in the name of these people, if ye are truthful, 31 They said, Praise thee, we know not except that which thou hast taught us, that thou art the All-Knowing, the Wise. 32 Adam, said, I will tell them by the name of their name, and when I warn them by their names, he said, Did I not tell you, I know the absence of heaven and earth, and I know what you seem, and ye were not secret? 33 

And when we said unto the king, Bow down unto Adam, and bow down except Iblis, my father, and be arrogant, and he was of the disbelievers, 34 And we said, Adam, thou and thy husband will dwell in Paradise, and each of them is prosperous, where they are cursed and do not draw near this tree, and they shall be of the two darknesses. 35 And the demon removed them from it, and he drove them away from what they were in, and we said, Bring down one another as an enemy, and for you in the earth is stable and possessive.

Until 36 And Adam received from his Lord, I spoke, and he repented unto him, that he is the most merciful repentant. 37 We said, Descend from them all: but when he comes to you from me as a guide, he who follows my guidance, there is no fear for them, nor do they grieve. 38 And those who disbelieved and lied about our house, Olek, accompany the fire, in which they are immortal. 39 Build Asriel, remember my graces, which have been blessed upon you, and fulfill my covenant, fulfill your covenant.

And ye fear 40 And believe in what I have revealed, believing in what is with you, and do not be the first to disbelieve in it, nor buy my house for a small price. And ye fear 41 And do not put the truth in the hero, and keep the truth secret: and you know, 42 And perform the prayer, and give alms, and kneel with the two kneelings, 43 You command men to be righteous, and forget yourselves, and you recite the Scriptures, will ye not be wise? 44 And seek the help of patience.

And the prayer and it is great except for the humble 45 who think that they have thrown their Lord and that they have returned to him 46 build Asriel remember my grace which I have blessed you and I have favored you for the flag 47 And fear a day that no soul shall be rewarded for a soul of something And no intercession shall be accepted from it nor shall justice be taken from it nor shall they be victorious 48 And when we deliver you from the Pharaoh, they poison you except for torment, they slaughter your sons 

And they shall be ashamed of your forgetfulness, and in that there is no great Lord of yours. 49 And when we parted with thee the sea, and we spared thee, and we drowned the Pharaoh, and ye look, 50 And when Moses promised us forty nights, and ye took the calf after him, and ye wronged, 51 And pardoned us from after that, that ye might be thankful, 52 And when Moses brought us the books, and the furnishings, that ye might be guided, 53 And when Moses said unto his people, He arises, That ye have been wronged. 

yourselves, by taking you the calf, and repent unto thy righteousness, and kill yourselves, it is good for thee when thy righteousness comes, and he repented unto thee, for he is the most merciful repentant. 54 And when ye said, Moses, We shall not believe thee, until we see God aloud, and thou shalt take thee thunderbolt, and ye see, 55 And we resurrected you from after thy death, that ye might be thankful, 56 And we kept the blinders upon thee, and we sent down manna upon thee, and solace, eat of the goodness of what


4. Scientific Series: "The Light of Reason and Authentic Contemplation" – Integration of Knowledge
Overall vision of the series:
This series is not just a collection of separate books, but rather an integrated knowledge structure, which aims to provide a comprehensive and gradual vision on how to revive the authentic contemplation of the Holy Qur'an in the digital age, relying on the original Qur'anic manuscripts. The series moves the reader from the theoretical basis "understanding Ottoman painting and linguistic rules derived from the Qur'an" to practical application "using digital tools in reflection", and then to civilizational construction "linking Qur'anic concepts to contemporary challenges".
The complementary relationship between books:
• The first book, Anwar al-Bayan, lays the linguistic and rhetorical basis for understanding the Qur'an, by focusing on Ottoman painting. It serves as the "entrance" to the world of contemplation.
• The second book, "New Rules": builds on the first book, and derives new linguistic rules from the Qur'anic text itself, deepening understanding and freeing it from traditional constraints. It serves as a "bridge" between text and reflection.
• The third book, "Contemplation in the Mirror of Drawings": moves on to the practical side, and provides practical models of how to use digital manuscripts in reflection. It serves as a "practical guide" for the contemplator.
• The fourth book, "New Concepts": links reflection with contemporary reality, and provides a civilized vision of how to apply Quranic concepts in our lives. It serves as the "future vision" of the project.
Breakdown of the four books with development proposals:
BookAxisProposed development1. Anwar al-Bayan in the drawing of the Ottoman Qur'an: revealing the secrets of the tongueOttoman painting: an in-depth study of the Ottoman drawing of the Qur'an, the differences between it and modern spelling painting, and the implications of these differences.1. Linking drawing to readings: Add an entire chapter that explains the close relationship between Uthmani painting and frequent Quranic readings, and how the difference in drawing is often related to a difference in reading. 2. Detailed examples: Include detailed examples of Qur'anic manuscripts "high-resolution images" illustrating the differences in the drawing, with an explanation of their possible implications. 3. Digital comparison tool: Attach a CD "or link to a website" containing a digital tool that allows the reader to compare the drawing of words in different manuscripts.2. New Rules for the Qur'anic Arabic Tongue: Deriving from the Qur'anic Text and Evidence of the Original ManuscriptsQur'anic linguistics: Deriving new grammar from the Qur'anic text itself (not just from traditional grammatical rules), based on Ottoman drawing in manuscripts, and on the analysis of Qur'anic contexts.1. Focus on context: Add a chapter that explains the importance of the Qur'anic context in understanding linguistic semantics, and how the context can outweigh one meaning over another. 2. Statistical analysis: The use of statistical analysis of Quranic words and phrases "such as the number of times they appear, and the contexts in which they appear" to derive linguistic rules. 3. Practical applications: Provide practical applications of new grammar in understanding certain Quranic verses.3. Contemplation in the Mirror of Drawings: Practical Applications of Digital Manuscripts in Contemplating the Qur'anDigital reflection: Provide practical models of how to use digital manuscripts (including available digital tools) in the management of the Holy Qur'an, with a focus on the methodology of "From Fasting to Hajj".1. Case Studies: Include detailed case studies  to analyze specific Qur'anic surahs using digital manuscripts, step by step. 2. Interactive exercises: Add interactive exercises for the reader, to apply what he learned from the book. 3. Models of Measures: Provide models of distinct reflections of Qur'anic verses, explaining how to access these measures using digital manuscripts. 4. Developing a digital "management assistant": Consider developing a digital "management assistant" "application or program" that accompanies the reader on the journey of reflection.4. New Concepts and Interactive Reflection: The Qur'an in the Age of Digitization and Digital ManuscriptsCivilizational construction: Linking major Quranic concepts "such as monotheism, justice, freedom, consultation" to contemporary challenges "such as injustice, tyranny, extremism, and climate change", and providing a Qur'anic vision to solve these problems. Focus on the importance of interaction and cooperation in reflection.1. Linking concepts to challenges: Dedicate an entire chapter to each Qur'anic concept, explaining how it relates to contemporary challenges, and how this concept can help solve these challenges. 2. Examples from reality: Provide real-life examples from the lives of Muslims "individuals and communities" that illustrate how Quranic concepts can be applied in the modern era. 3. Call to Action: Include a clear invitation to the reader to participate in the project and in building a better future for the Islamic Ummah. 4. Foreseeing the future: adding a chapter on the future of reflection in light of technological developments.General proposals for the development of the series:
• Attractive design: Design books in an attractive and modern way, and use illustrations, pictures and mind maps to facilitate understanding.
• Clear language: Use clear and easy classical Arabic, avoiding complex terminology as much as possible.
• Translation: Translate the series into other languages "such as English and French" to circulate interest.
• Digital Publishing: Publishing the series in digital format "such as PDF or EPUB" in addition to the printed version.
• Marketing: Develop an integrated marketing plan for the series, to reach the largest possible segment of readers.
• Engage with readers: Create an online forum or discussion group for readers, to discuss book ideas and share experiences.
Conclusion:
The "Light of Reason and Authentic Contemplation" series is an ambitious project, which aims to provide an integrated vision on how to revive Quranic reflection in the digital age. Through the integration of the four books, by focusing on authenticity and modernity, and by employing technology to serve the Book of God, this series can contribute to building a new Qur'anic renaissance.
5. The project of digitizing Quranic manuscripts: a revolution in the study of the Qur'anic text
Thanks to tremendous technological advances, the digitization of Qur'anic manuscripts has become not just an option, but an imperative for Qur'anic scholars, researchers, and thinkers alike. This step enables them to study the Qur'anic text with the highest degree of accuracy, compare different manuscripts easily and easily, and open new horizons for scientific research.

1. Manuscripts that have been digitized "so far":
• Topkapi's Qur'an "Istanbul" attributed to Othman bin Affan:
o It is digitized and made available in three versions:
1. With images of the original manuscript "without specifying the end of lines": This allows the manuscript to be seen as it is.
2. No manuscript images: digital text copy only, for research and analysis.
3. With original manuscript images + end-of-line marking: This helps in tracking the text and determining the stops positions.
• The project of digitizing the Cairo version "in progress":
o The completion rate has reached 20% "to date".
The digitization of the following manuscripts from other sources has also been accomplished, which also contain differences in the writing of the same word and are therefore more instructive and more accurate:
• The original digital manuscript of the Holy Qur'an for the contemplators: Tubkabi Qur'an attributed to Osman in Istanbul Payhip           
• Manuscript of Qab Saray "also attributed to Uthman ibn Affan":
o It has been digitized as an interactive digital version "i.e. can be searched, comments added, ... etc".


2. Benefits of digitizing manuscripts "for contemplators and researchers":
• Careful study of textual differences:
o An accurate comparison between the way words are written in ancient Qur'anic manuscripts (such as the Tub Qabi Qur'an) and the printed and electronic Qur'ans currently in circulation.
o Uncover the "often unintentional" human judgments that have been introduced into word drawing through the ages.
o A deeper understanding of the reasons for the different readings of the Qur'an.
• Fast and accurate statistics and analysis:
o Count the number of times words and letters are repeated accurately and quickly.
o Analyze where differences are drawn in a single word (such as "prayer," sometimes spelled "prayer"), and understand the possible connotations behind these differences.
o Study the contexts in which different words are mentioned.
• Advantages of advanced technology "facilitates research and reflection":
o Search for words without having to enter diacritics "Fatha, Damma, Kasra, ... etc".
o Search for several adjacent words at once "such as "the Most Merciful"".
o Easily correct errors caused by manual transcription in digital copies.

6. "Create Your Digital Quranic Manuscript: Your Practical Guide to Reflection in the Digital Age"
Introduction:
 Have you ever imagined that you have your own "Quran", where you can write your thoughts, record your reflections, add your interpretations, link verses together, and bring together everything related to your understanding of the Book of God in one place?
This is what the "personal digital manuscript" offers you! It is not just an electronic version of the Qur'an, it is your personal guide to more general contemplation of discovering the treasures of the Qur'an.
How to make your own digital manuscript?
The personal digital manuscript is an innovative tool that aims to enable the contemplator to interact with the Qur'anic text personally and effectively, while maintaining a scientific and legal methodology. This manuscript is not just a digital copy of the Qur'an, but an interactive space that allows the contemplative to record his reflections, link them to educational resources, and organize his understanding of the verses, all without rushing to publish them before they mature and consult scholars.
1. Benefits of a Personal Digital Manuscript
• Enhance interaction with the Qur'an:
o The manuscript makes reflection an interactive and personal process, deepening the contemplation's attachment to the Qur'an, making it "alive" in his heart and mind.
o This interaction helps to transform the Qur'an from a readable text into a lived and understandable text.
A- Building a cumulative understanding:
o Recording the reflections periodically helps the contemplative to build a cumulative understanding of the Qur'an, as he can refer to and develop his previous reflections, as if he were building an "edifice" of understanding.
o  "The Qur'an is the spring of hearts, the clarity of sorrows, and the disappearance of worries and ambiguities."
B- Encouraging scientific research:
o  The manuscript encourages the contemplative to research and study, as it becomes a tool for collecting scientific information and references, as if he is creating his own "library" about the Qur'an.
o This promotes a culture of scientific research among Muslims, linking heritage and contemporary.
C- Protection from anomalous interpretations:
o By consulting scientists before publication, the contemplative is protected from falling into abnormal interpretations or contrary to the consensus of scientists, as science is taken from the mouths of scientists.
o This ensures that the measures are within the correct Shariah framework.
D- Facilitate constructive engagement:
o  Once the measures are matured and revised, the contemplator can share them with others via digital platforms, enriching the scholarly dialogue about the Qur'an and opening the door for constructive discussion.
o This participation can inspire others and encourage them to engage in the process of reflection.
E- Tool for Purification: The digital manuscript is a means of purification of the soul through the continuous contemplation of the Book of Allah, "I have succeeded from its zakat."

2. The importance of a personal digital manuscript
A- Recording personal measures:
o The digital manuscript allows the meditator to record his thoughts and reflections on the verses, helping him to trace the evolution of his understanding of the Qur'anic text over time, as if to create a "record" of his faith journey.
o These dispensations can include personal explanations, questions, deductions, or even spiritual thoughts.
B- Linking video tutorials:
o The meditator can add links to videos or lectures by sheikhs and scholars to help him understand the verses more deeply and comprehensively.
o This feature makes the manuscript an integrated center of learning, combining personal reflection with learning from scholars.
C- Organizing verses according to understanding:
o The manuscript allows verses to be classified and organized according to the themes or concepts that the contemplative deduces, as if creating a "mind map" of the Holy Qur'an.
o  This organization helps to build a comprehensive vision of the Qur'an, where verses that are similar or complementary in meaning can be linked.
D- Do not rush to publish:
o The personal manuscript encourages the contemplative to "scientific silence" "the stage of fasting" until he reaches the stage of maturity in his understanding, so that he does not rush to publish unless he is sure of his correctness.
o  This corresponds to the methodology of scientific research, where ideas are published only after their validity and usefulness are confirmed.
E- Scientific Consultation:
o  Before publishing any measure, the contemplative must consult scientists and specialists to ensure the validity of his findings, as science is a womb among his people
o This ensures that the published measures are of scientific and legitimate value, and serve society rather than cause confusion or misguidance.

3. How to use a personal digital manuscript
A- Fasting phase "individual meditation":
o At this stage, the contemplative person delves into the study of the verses, and records his reflections in the manuscript without sharing them with others.
o He can use approved interpretations, watch educational videos, and link them to his personal understanding.
You can use apps like Evernote,  OneNote, or even a simple Word  document.
B- Maturity stage "scientific consultation":
o After the measures are completed, the contemplative presents them to the scientists for evaluation and review, as science is taken only from the mouths of scientists.
o This stage ensures that the measures are correct and beneficial to everyone.
C- Hajj phase "mass deployment":
o Once validated, the measures can be disseminated via digital platforms to spread the benefit, emphasizing the importance of respecting the opinions of others.
o This stage is similar to Hajj, where benefits are shared with the community after maturity is complete.
Dealing with differences in understanding:
o It is natural for contemplators to differ in understanding some verses, and this difference "within the legal controls" is evidence of the richness of the Qur'anic text. The opinions of others must be respected, personal opinion should not be fanatic, and the search for the truth should always be sought.
4.  By 
recording the reflections, linking them to educational resources, and consulting scholars, the contemplator is able to understand the Qur'an more deeply and accurately. This manuscript is not only a personal tool, but also a means of serving the community by disseminating mature and useful measures.

In this way, the digital manuscript becomes a bridge between personal understanding of the Qur'an and collective interaction with it, promoting a culture of reflection and scientific research in the Islamic Ummah.

7. Digital Manuscripts: Now Available!
Thanks to God Almighty, the digitization of the original manuscripts of the Holy Qur'an attributed to Othman bin Affan (Topkapi Museum copy) was completed in three formats ... (as in the original text) ...
The project of digitizing the original manuscript of the Holy Qur'an attributed to Othman bin Affan (Cairo version) is also currently being completed, and the completion has reached 20%.
Important:
• "Original Manuscripts": We mean here the ancient Qur'anic manuscripts written in the early centuries of Islam, from the Ottoman Qur'an.
• "Signs added by scholars to facilitate reading" : such as dots, diacritics, hamza, and symbols such as the small xiphoid alif that indicate the tide and the increase or deletion of some letters such as the alif waw and the signs of cessation and beginning. These signs were not present in the first Qur'ans, and were later added with the diligence of the scholars.
In addition:
Other Qur'anic manuscripts (from various sources) have been digitized, and also contain variations in the drawing of words. This diversity of manuscripts enriches scientific research and helps to understand the development of Ottoman painting.

8. "Digital Quranic Manuscripts: A Weapon in the Battle to Preserve the Qur'anic Text"
Introduction:
The Holy Qur'an is the miraculous word of God, preserved by memorizing it, as Glory be to Him said: "We have revealed the dhikr and we are his keepers" "Al-Hajar: 9". This divine promise of memorization was not just words, but was embodied in the reality of the Islamic Ummah over the centuries, through oral and written frequency, and through the efforts of scholars in memorizing, controlling and interpreting the Qur'anic text.
Same to you... Does this mean that the Holy Qur'an has not been subjected to attempts to question or distort? Is our role limited to absolute delivery without examination or consideration?
The truth is that the Qur'an, like any sacred text, has faced and will face attempts to question its authenticity, to challenge its credibility, or to distort its meanings. These attempts come from different sides, and for a variety of reasons, including:
• Human demons: as described by the Holy Qur'an, they are individuals or groups who seek to extinguish the light of God, and to divert people from the truth, by spreading suspicions and falsehoods, embellishing falsehood, and distorting the word from its places.
• Biased orientalists: those who try to question the authenticity of the Qur'anic text, the history of its compilation and codification, and its divine source.
• People with passions and heresies: those who try to twist the necks of texts to match their whims, or to justify their heresies and delusions.
• Ignorant and transcendent: those who dare to interpret the Qur'an without knowledge, and speak in the Book of Allah without guidance or insight.
How can digital Qur'anic manuscripts help us counter these attempts?
The project of digitizing Quranic manuscripts is not just an archival or technological project, but a project with deep strategic dimensions, as it represents:
1. A weapon in the battle of awareness: by making the original Qur'anic manuscripts available to everyone, and enabling them to access the Qur'anic text as it was revealed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and as written by the honorable companions.
2. A powerful tool to respond to suspicions: by providing compelling physical evidence of the authenticity and frequency of the Qur'anic text, and that it has not been distorted or altered over the centuries.
3. An effective way to enhance certainty: by enabling Muslims to see ancient Qur'anic manuscripts with their own eyes, compare them with printed Qur'ans, and ensure their identical.
4. A platform for scientific research: by providing advanced digital tools for researchers, enabling them to study Quranic manuscripts more deeply and accurately, and to discover their semantic treasures.
5. A bridge between the past and the present: by connecting Muslims to their scientific heritage, and introducing them to the efforts of their ancestors in preserving the Book of God.
Detailing the role of digital manuscripts:
• Response to skeptics of Ottoman painting:
o Digital manuscripts display the Qur'anic text in authentic Ottoman script, invalidating the claims of skeptics who claim that the Ottoman painting is not tawqif, or that it has been altered.
o Different manuscripts can be compared, and to ensure their conformity in the Ottoman painting, which confirms the frequency of this drawing.
• Response to skeptics in Quranic readings:
o Digital manuscripts help to understand the relationship between Uthmani painting and Qur'anic readings, and to realize that the difference in readings does it mean the difference in the text, is it a difference in performances. The answer is what is the correct reading and formation of the word in the Qur'an and whether all readings are correct, all of this is done by deep reflection to study the few differences of the Qur'an, it is possible to refer to ancient manuscripts to verify the validity of frequent readings.
• Response to skeptics in the collection of the Qur'an:
o Ancient Qur'anic manuscripts (such as the Sana'a manuscript) date back to the first century AH, which confirms that the Holy Qur'an was compiled in an early era, and that it was not subjected to change or distortion.
o Different manuscripts can be compared, and to ensure that they are identical in the text, confirming the frequency of the Qur'an.
• Response to Sunni deniers:
o Digital manuscripts reinforce the value of the Prophet's Sunnah as a major source of understanding of the Qur'an.
• Confronting anomalous interpretations:
o Digital manuscripts enable the contemplative to return to the original text, and to understand it directly, without the mediation of abnormal or perverted interpretations.
o Different commentaries can be compared to manuscripts, ascertaining their compatibility with the original text.
• Promote authentic reflection:
o Digital manuscripts encourage reflection on the verses of the Qur'an, and to try to understand their meanings and connotations.
o The provision of digital tools to aid reflection (such as research, comparison and interpretation tools) makes reflection easier and more effective practice.
Practical examples:
• Sana'a Codex:
o The discovery of the Sana'a manuscript in Yemen "in the seventies of the twentieth century" was a historical event, as this manuscript "dating back to the first century AH" proved that the Qur'anic text was not subject to change over the centuries.
o The digitization of this manuscript and its availability to all will enable researchers and thinkers to study it more deeply, and to use it in responding to skeptics.
• Comparison of manuscripts:
o By comparing different Qur'anic manuscripts, researchers can discover subtle differences in Uthmani painting, understand the reasons for these differences, and relate them to Qur'anic readings.
o This comparison also helps to understand the evolution of Ottoman painting over time.
Conclusion:
The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts is vital and necessary, not only for the preservation of Islamic heritage, but also for the defense of the Holy Qur'an, and to respond to suspicions raised about it. It is a project that represents a powerful weapon in the battle of consciousness, and in the battle to preserve the identity of the nation and its sanctities.
Call to action:
We call on all Muslims, especially scholars, researchers and contemplatives, to:
• Supporting this project: financially and morally.
• Participation in it: through reflection, research, and publication.
• Use available digital tools: in reflection and study.
• Spreading awareness: the importance of the project and the importance of Quranic manuscripts.
Let us make this project a success story, and let us make this digital age a golden age of Quranic reflection!
9. "Contemplation of Manuscripts: Towards an Authentic Reading of the Holy Qur'an"
Introduction:
"Do they not contemplate the Qur'an or on the hearts of its locks?" "Muhammad: 24". This verse is not just a deprecating question, but an urgent invitation for every Muslim to interact with the book of his Lord, to go beyond superficial reading to deep understanding, and to make the Holy Qur'an a source of guidance and light in his life.
Same to you... How do we manage? What tools help us reflect? Is it enough to refer to the approved interpretations, or is there something beyond that?
This passage calls for a return to the roots, to the original Qur'anic manuscripts, and for direct reflection of the Qur'anic text, as a way to a deeper and more authentic understanding of the Book of God.
1. Qur'anic Manuscripts: A Window on the Original Text:
• Ottoman painting: Ancient Qur'anic manuscripts "such as the Qur'an of Uthman" were written in the Ottoman script, which differs in some details from modern spelling.
• They are not just differences: these differences are not just spelling errors, they often carry deeper connotations, and are associated with frequent Qur'anic readings.
• Examples:
o "Muqalid" instead of "reins": in the verse of al-Zumar "63". This drawing may indicate that the word is not just "keys" in the literal sense, but rather "causes", "means" and "reins" in the hands of God.
o "Heavens" instead of "heavens": This drawing may indicate that the word means not only physical "heavens," but also "height," "elevation," and "transcendence."
• Digitization Project:  The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts provides us with a golden opportunity to study these differences, and to better understand Ottoman painting.
2. Contemplation: the key to understanding:
• Contemplation is not an explanation: Contemplation is not just knowing the meanings of words and sentences, but contemplating and meditating on verses, and trying to understand their intentions and connotations.
• Contemplation is a personal process: Contemplation is a personal process, which varies from person to person, according to his knowledge, knowledge and experience.
• Contemplation needs tools: Contemplation needs auxiliary tools, such as:
o Knowledge of the Arabic language: and understanding its methods and characteristics.
o Refer to interpretations that are based on the old and new Qur'an.
o Using manuscripts: to study Ottoman painting and understand its implications.
• Contemplation and remembrance: "Dhikr" in the words of the Almighty: "We have revealed the dhikr and we are his keepers" "Al-Hajar: 9" is not limited to the Qur'anic text itself, but also includes what is deduced from this text by correct reflection. Every correct understanding of the Qur'an is a "dhikr" from God, and it is preserved by God's protection.
3. Contemplation and "touching" the Qur'an:
• "Incident: 79": This verse speaks not only of physical purity, but also of spiritual and intellectual purity.
• Purification from impurities: In order to "touch" the Qur'an (i.e., understand it and be aware of its meanings), we must cleanse our hearts and minds of impurities and prejudices, and of fanaticism of traditional opinions.
• Contemplation is purification: Contemplation is the means by which we purify our hearts and minds, and it is the one that enables us to "touch" the Qur'an "that is, to understand" it correctly.
4. Contemplation and worldly reward:
• The "paradise" of science and knowledge: Contemplation is not limited to the hereafter, but the contemplative enjoys a worldly "paradise", which is the paradise of science, knowledge, light, insight and tranquility.
• "Rivers" of science: This paradise is "underneath it" of science and knowledge, flowing continuously, and increasing as the contemplative delved into his contemplation.
5. Example: "Mosque" and "Mosques":
• Difference in drawing: In some verses, the word "mosque" is written "singular", and in other verses "mosques" are written "plural".
• Contemplation: This difference in drawing is not just a spelling difference, it is a difference in meaning.
o "Mosque" "singular": may refer to the Grand Mosque, the mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him), or any particular mosque.
o "Mosques" "plural": refers to all mosques everywhere.
• The importance of attention to detail: This example illustrates the importance of paying attention to the subtleties in Ottoman painting, and how these details can affect meaning.
6. Proposed reflection methodology:
1. Back to Manuscripts: Start studying the original Qur'anic manuscripts.
2. Using readings: Benefiting from frequent Quranic readings in understanding verses.
3. Refer to interpretations: Use approved interpretations, but not absolutely.
4. Activating the mind: Using the mind and critical thinking in understanding verses.
5. Linking to reality: trying to link verses to contemporary reality.
6. Register and share: Record personal measures, and share them with others "after review".
Conclusion:
Contemplation is the key to a correct understanding of the Holy Qur'an, and it is the path to firm certainty and fruitful work. The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts provides us with a golden opportunity to revive reflection in the digital age, to return to the originals, and to understand the Book of God more deeply and authentically.
Let us make contemplation the project of our lives, and let us make this digital age a golden age of understanding the Book of God!

10. Digital Manuscripts: A Shield and a Sword in the Battle to Preserve the Qur'anic Text 
Introduction to "Appeal to Awareness":
"We have revealed the dhikr and we are his keepers" (al-Hijr: 9).
This categorical divine promise, engraved in the hearts of believers, resonates through the centuries, confirming that the Holy Qur'an will remain preserved from distortion and alteration, no matter how intense the storms of skepticism and no matter how dark the forces of darkness overwhelm it.
Same to you... Does God's preservation of His Book mean that we rest in silence, content with absolute submission, without seeking to understand His Book, without defending Him, without using all our might to protect Him?
Of course not! God Almighty has given us many reasons to memorize His Book, including:
• Frequency : The Qur'an was transmitted generation to generation, orally and in writing, in numbers that are impossible to collude in lying.
• Scholars: Those who have made strenuous efforts in memorizing the Qur'an, controlling it, interpreting and teaching it.
• Manuscripts: which represent the "living memory" of the Qur'anic text, and the physical witness to its history.
In our time, the age of the digital revolution, a new weapon is emerging in this battle, a double-edged sword, which can be a tool for good or for evil: technology.
Technology: double-edged sword "detail":
• The devastating limit of "how technology can be used against the Qur'an":
o Spreading suspicions: The Internet and social media can be used to spread suspicions and falsehoods about the Qur'an, about its history, about its source, and about its meanings.
• Examples: Atheistic websites and forums, anti-Islamic YouTube channels, Twitter and Facebook accounts promoting deviant ideas.
o Falsification of facts: Photo and video editing software can be used to falsify Quranic manuscripts, create false "manuscripts", or distort the meanings of verses.
o Misinformation: Technology can be used to mislead people and convince them of wrong interpretations of the Qur'an, incorrect readings, or ideas that contradict the fundamentals of religion.
o Influence on youth: Young people "who are more tech-savvy" can be targeted with distorted messages about the Qur'an and attempts to shake their faith.
• Muammar limit "How technology can be used to defend the Qur'an":
o Spreading the truth: The internet and social media can be used to spread facts about the Qur'an, to respond to suspicions and falsehoods, and to provide correct interpretation of verses.
o Providing tools: Technology can be used to provide tools and resources that help people understand and contemplate the Qur'an, and study its various sciences.
• Examples: Qur'an reading applications, tafsir websites, Qur'an research programs, digital manuscripts.
o Building a Community: Technology can be used to build a community of contemplators, researchers and scientists, working together to serve, defend, and spread awareness of the Book of God.
o Heritage preservation: Technology can be used to digitize ancient Quranic manuscripts, protect them from damage and loss, and make them available to all.
Quranic Manuscript Digitization Project: Why is it important?
The Qur'anic Manuscripts Digitization Project is a very important strategic project, which aims to harness technology to serve the Holy Qur'an, defend it, and revive reflection in the Ummah. It represents:
1. Daraa protects the Qur'anic text:
o Irrefutable physical evidence: Ancient Qur'anic manuscripts (such as the Sana'a manuscript, the Topkapi Qur'an, and the Cairo Qur'an) are the earliest physical evidence of the Qur'anic text. The digitization of these manuscripts and their availability to all "in high-resolution images, with tools for research and comparison" provides compelling physical evidence of the authenticity and frequency of the Qur'anic text, and of its non-distortion over the centuries.
• Examples:
• Sana'a Codex: The discovery of this manuscript "dating back to the first century AH" proved that the Qur'anic text we have today is the same text that existed at that time.
• Comparison of manuscripts: Comparing different manuscripts (such as the Sana'a manuscript and the Tubjabi Qur'an) proves that the differences between them are very minor, and do not touch the essence of the Qur'anic text.
o Comparison and validation: Digital manuscripts enable researchers and even the general public to easily compare different manuscripts, to ensure that they are identical in the main text, and to identify minor differences (if any) and interpret them in the light of reading and drawing.
o Exposing distortions "if any": If anyone tries "past or present" to make changes to the Qur'anic text, digital manuscripts will act as a "witness" to expose it, as it will reveal any difference between the original text and the distorted text.
o Digital preservation:  The digitization of manuscripts protects them from damage and loss "due to fires, floods, wars or neglect", and ensures their survival for future generations.
2. A sword that cuts off suspicion:
o Responding to skeptics: Digital manuscripts provide researchers and scholars with the physical evidence they need to respond to skeptics' suspicions about the authenticity of the Qur'anic text, the date of its compilation and codification, and its divine source.
• Examples:
• Response to those who claim that the Qur'an was compiled only long after the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him): It can be answered by showing ancient Qur'anic manuscripts dating back to the first century AH.
• Responding to those who claim that there are different "copies" of the Qur'an: It can be answered by comparing different manuscripts, and showing their conformity in the main text.
• Response to those who question the Ottoman painting: It can be answered by explaining the wisdom of the Ottoman painting, and how it corresponds to frequent readings.
o Facilitating scientific research: Digital manuscripts provide advanced tools for research and analysis, enabling researchers to study Ottoman painting, Quranic readings, the history of the compilation of the Qur'an, and other Qur'anic sciences, deeper, more accurately and faster.
o Spreading awareness: Making digital manuscripts available to everyone (not just to specialized scholars) contributes to raising awareness of the importance of Islamic heritage, the importance of preserving the Qur'anic text, and the importance of reflection.
o Confronting anomalous interpretations: Digital manuscripts enable the contemplative to return to the original text, and to understand it directly, without the mediation of abnormal or perverted interpretations that may divert the text from its intentions.
Practical examples "clarifying":
• Difference in drawing the word "prayer":
o Some manuscripts are written "salwa" "in waw", and some are written "salat" "in thousand".
o Digital manuscripts enable us to compare these different drawings, to refer to Ottoman painting books to find out why this difference is made, and to understand the possible implications of each drawing.
• Difference in the reading of the word "king":
o Some readers read it "Malik" by "proving the thousand", and some read it "Malik" by "deleting the thousand".
o Digital manuscripts enable us to see how this word was written in ancient Qur'ans, and whether it contained alif or not.
o We can also refer to the books of readings to find out the origin of each reading, and to see the scholars who read them.
Call to action:
The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts is a vital and necessary project, not only for the preservation of Islamic heritage, but also for the defense of the Holy Qur'an, and to respond to suspicions raised about it. It is a project that represents a powerful weapon in the battle of consciousness, and in the battle to preserve the identity of the nation and its sanctities.
Therefore, we invite:
• Scientists and researchers: to study digital manuscripts, and to benefit from them in their research and studies.
• Contemplators: to use digital manuscripts in the contemplation of the Qur'an, and to try to understand it more deeply and authentically.
• General Muslims: To support this project financially and morally, and to spread awareness of its importance.
• Governments and institutions: to provide the necessary support for the project, and to facilitate the procedures related to it.
Let us make this project a success story, and make this digital age a golden age of understanding the Book of God!

11. Contemplation: the key to correct reading and correct formation "refuting suspicions about readings and drawing"
Introduction:
﴿Do they not contemplate the Qur'an or on the hearts of its locks﴾ "Muhammad: 24".
This verse is not just a rebuke to those who are oblivious to the Book of Allah, but an explicit and direct invitation to every Muslim to interact with the Holy Qur'an, to go beyond superficial reading to deep understanding, and to make the Qur'an a source of guidance and light in his life.
Same to you... Is it enough to read the Qur'an in passing, or to memorize it by heart without understanding its meanings? Is it enough to go back to traditional interpretations, without thinking for ourselves, and without trying to understand the Qur'an directly?
Contemplation is the answer. Contemplation is the key to a correct understanding of the Holy Qur'an, it is the most powerful weapon in the face of suspicions raised around it, and it is the path to firm certainty and sincere faith.
Contemplation: what is it? Why is it important?
• Contemplation is not just reading: contemplation is a conscious and careful reading that goes beyond simply pronouncing letters and words, and reaches contemplating meanings and connotations.
• Contemplation is not memorization: contemplation is understanding and applying, not just memorizing and memorization.
• Contemplation is not merely an interpretation: contemplation is an attempt to directly understand the Qur'anic text, with the help of interpretations "but not absolutely".
• Contemplation is:
o Think about the signs of God, their meanings, and their connotations.
o Meditate: in the greatness of God, in His power, in His wisdom.
o Interaction: With the Qur'an with a humbled heart and an open mind.
o Linkage: between verses and context, and between the Qur'an and reality.
o Deduction: Deriving lessons from verses.
o Application: Apply what we learn from the Qur'an in our lives.
Contemplation and Digital Manuscripts: A Close Relationship:
The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts provides an ideal environment for reflection, through:
• Availability of the original text: Enabling the contemplative to return to the Qur'anic text as written in the first Qur'an "before adding dots and diacritics", freeing the mind from the constraints that may be imposed by subsequent readings or interpretations.
• Provide tools for comparison: enable the examiner to compare different manuscripts, to observe minor differences in the drawing, and to understand the reasons for these differences.
• Facilitating searching: Enabling the contemplative to search for words and phrases in the Qur'anic text, to track their occurrence in different places, and to understand the general context of the verse.
• Access to Tafsir: Provide links to approved interpretations (but not in a way that eliminates the role of reason), to help the contemplative understand verses that may be difficult for him to understand on his own.
• Recording of measures: Enable the contemplative to record his personal measures, and share them with others "after reviewing them".
Contemplation and Qur'anic readings "refuting suspicions":
• Suspicion: Some say that frequent Qur'anic readings (such as those of Hafs, Warsh and Qalon) are a distortion of the Qur'an, and that there is one "correct reading" that we should adopt.
• Response:
o Frequent readings are not a distortion: frequent readings are different aspects of the reading approved by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and they are all from God.
• Evidence:  The hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): "The Qur'an was revealed in seven letters" (Sahih al-Bukhari).
o The difference in readings does not mean the difference in the text:  the difference in readings is a difference in pronunciation, and in some linguistic connotations, but it does not affect the essence of the Qur'anic text.
o Readings enrich meaning: Differences in readings enrich meaning, open new horizons for understanding, and reveal aspects of linguistic and graphic miracles in the Qur'an.
o Manuscripts support readings: Ancient Qur'anic manuscripts "written in Ottoman script" tolerate different frequent readings.
o Contemplation is the solution: contemplation is what helps us understand the wisdom of having different readings, and to realize how each reading adds a new dimension to meaning.
Ottoman contemplation and painting "refuting suspicions":
• Suspicion: Some say that the Ottoman drawing "the way words are written in ancient Qur'ans" is just an old way of writing, and that we should write the Qur'an in modern spelling.
• Response:
o Ottoman painting is not just a way of writing: Ottoman painting is an essential part of memorizing the Holy Qur'an, and it is frequent from the Companions.
o Ottoman painting carries  with it linguistic and rhetorical connotations that may not be evident in modern spelling painting.
o Digital Manuscripts:  The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts helps us better understand Ottoman painting and discover its hidden connotations.
o Examples:
• "Prayer": Writing the word in Waw in some places may indicate the origin of the word, the meaning of supplication, or the importance of prayer.
• Small alif: It may indicate that this alif is pronounced and not written, or it may indicate a special meaning of the word.
Contemplation and wording "refutation of suspicions":
• Suspicion: Some say that the diacritics are an essential part of the Qur'anic text, and that it is not permissible to read the Qur'an without tashkil.
• Response:
o The diacritics are not home: the diacritics were not present in the first Qur'ans, and were added later to facilitate reading and prevent melody.
o Contemplation precedes diacritics: It is reflection that helps us understand the original meaning of the word "before adding diacritics" and to determine which diacritics are best suited to the context.
o Flexibility in formation: A single word can tolerate more than one formation, and each formation gives a different meaning. Contemplation helps to choose the most appropriate formation.
o Examples:
• "King": It can read "owner" or "king".
• "They know": You can read "You know" or "They teach".
Proposed reflection methodology "practical steps":
1. Return to the originals: Start studying the original Qur'anic manuscripts "through the digital platform".
2. Use frequent readings: Understand the different aspects of readings, and how they affect meaning.
3. Word analysis:
o Root: Find the root of the word in the Arabic language, and understand its different meanings.
o Pairs: Search for words or roots that may be related to the word "antonymically, complementarly, or otherwise".
o Syllabic letters: Trying to understand the semantics of broken letters "if a verse includes broken letters".
4. Context study: Understanding the verse in its context "the verses before and after it, and the surah in which it appears".
5. Use of interpretations: Refer to approved interpretations (such as those of al-Tabari, Ibn Kathir and al-Qurtubi), but not absolutely, but with a critical eye.
6. Critical thinking: the use of reason and critical thinking in understanding the verse, and not absolute submission to everything that is said.
7. Linking to reality: Trying to link the verse to contemporary reality and personal life.
8. Registration and sharing: Recording personal arrangements in a special digital manuscript, and sharing them with others "after review".
Controls of management "to prevent abuse":
• Commitment to the Arabic tongue deduced from the Qur'an .
• Contextualization: Do not interpret the verse in isolation from its context.
• Seek the help of scientists: Refer to scientists and specialists in case of any doubt or hesitation.
• Not violating the laws of God: Not interpreting the verse in a sense that contradicts natural laws.
• Non-contradiction of logic: Not interpreting the verse in a sense that contradicts sound reason.
• Non-violation of common sense: Not interpreting the verse in a sense that contradicts common sense.
• Discouragement of evil: Not interpreting the verse in a sense that justifies violence, injustice, or corruption.
Conclusion:
Contemplation is the key to a correct understanding of the Holy Qur'an, and it is the most powerful weapon in the face of suspicions raised around it. The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts provides us with a golden opportunity to revive reflection in the digital age, to return to the originals, and to understand the Book of God more deeply and authentically.
Let us make contemplation the project of our lives, and let us make this digital age a golden age of understanding the Book of God!

13. The importance of a personal digital manuscript for every contemplator  

The personal digital manuscript is an innovative tool that aims to enable the contemplator to interact with the Qur'anic text personally and effectively, while maintaining a scientific and legal methodology. This manuscript is not just a digital copy of the Qur'an, but an interactive space that allows the contemplative to record his reflections, link them to educational resources, and organize his understanding of the verses without rushing to publish them before they mature.  



 The importance of a personal digital manuscript  

1. Registration of personal measures:  
   - The digital manuscript allows the contemplative to record his thoughts and reflections on the verses, which helps him to trace the evolution of his understanding of the Qur'anic text over time.  
   These measures can include personal explanations, questions, deductions, or even spiritual thoughts.  

2. Linking video tutorials:  
   - The contemplative can add links to videos or lectures by sheikhs and scholars to help him understand the verses more deeply.  
   - This feature makes the manuscript an integrated center of learning, combining personal reflection with learning from scholars.  

3. Organizing verses according to understanding:  
   - The manuscript allows the classification of verses and their organization according to the topics or concepts that the contemplator deduces.  
   - This organization helps to build a comprehensive vision of the Qur'an, where verses that are similar or complementary in meaning can be linked.  

4. Do not rush to publish:  
   - The personal manuscript encourages the contemplative to remain silent "the stage of fasting" until he reaches the stage of maturity in his understanding.  
   - This is consistent with the methodology of scientific research, where ideas are not published until their validity and usefulness are verified.  

5. Scientific Consultation:  
   - Before publishing any measure, the thinker can consult scientists and specialists to ensure the validity of his findings.  
   - This ensures that the published measures are of scientific and legitimate value, and serve the community rather than cause confusion or misguidance.  



 Benefits of a Personal Digital Manuscript  

1. Enhance interaction with the Qur'an:  
   - The manuscript makes reflection an interactive and personal process, deepening the contemplation's attachment to the Qur'an.  
   - This interaction helps to transform the Qur'an from a readable text into a lived and understandable text.  

2. Build a cumulative understanding:  
   - Recording the measures periodically helps the contemplative to build a cumulative understanding of the Qur'an, as he can refer to his previous reflections and develop them.  

3. Encouraging scientific research:  
   - The manuscript encourages the contemplative to research and study, as it becomes a tool for collecting scientific information and references.  
   - This promotes a culture of scientific research among Muslims, and links heritage and contemporary.  

4. Protection from anomalous interpretations:  
   - By consulting scholars before publication, the thinker is protected from falling into abnormal interpretations or contrary to the consensus of scholars.  
   - This ensures that the measures are within the correct legal framework.  

5. Facilitate constructive engagement:  
   - After the measures are matured and reviewed, the contemplator can share them with others via digital platforms, enriching the scientific dialogue about the Qur'an.  
   This participation can inspire others and encourage them to engage in the reflection process.  



 How to use a personal digital manuscript  

1. Fasting phase "individual meditation":  
   - At this stage, the contemplative delvs into the study of the verses, and records his reflections in the manuscript without sharing them with others.  
   - He can use approved interpretations, watch educational videos, and link them to his personal understanding.  

2. Maturity stage "scientific consultation":  
   - After the measures are completed, the contemplative presents them to the scientists for evaluation and review.  
   - This stage ensures that the measures are correct and beneficial to everyone.  

3. Hajj stage "mass deployment":  
   - After confirming the correctness of the measures, they can be disseminated via digital platforms to spread the benefit.  
   - This stage is similar to Hajj, where the benefits are shared with the community after maturity is complete.  



 The bottom line  

The personal digital manuscript is a powerful tool to enhance personal reflection on the Qur'an, by recording the reflections, linking them to educational resources, and consulting scholars, the contemplator becomes able to understand the Qur'an more deeply and accurately. This manuscript is not only a personal tool, but also a means of serving the community by disseminating mature and useful measures.  

In this way, the digital manuscript becomes a bridge between personal understanding of the Qur'an and collective interaction with it, promoting a culture of reflection and scientific research in the Islamic Ummah.

14. Introduction to the project of digitizing the original manuscripts of the Holy Qur'an and the Four Book Series: The Light of Reason and Authentic Contemplation  

"The Qur'an is guidance, healing, sustenance and light for the believers", with these great words God describes his dear book, stressing that it is the great blessing that guides hearts, heals chests, and illuminates paths. The scholars of the Ummah have made strenuous efforts over the centuries to memorize this great book and facilitate its understanding, setting the formation and points and establishing the rules of recitation. However, these blessed efforts, to the extent that they facilitated the outward reading, inadvertently obscured some of the beauty and contemplative depth of the authentic Qur'anic text.  

In this context, the project of digitizing the original manuscripts of the Holy Qur'an is a unique initiative, which aims to make the Qur'anic text available in its form closer to the moment of revelation, before adding touches of human diligence to it. The digitization of these manuscripts, especially the Ottoman Qur'an, is not merely a work of art, but a call to revive authentic reflection and to encourage critical thinking that transcends blind imitation.  



 Why are digital manuscripts key to authentic reflection?  
1. Transcending "unconscious delivery": Digital manuscripts, with their different drawings and composition, reveal to us that the original Qur'anic text was too broad to be reduced to a single reading or stereotypical understanding. It is an invitation to examine legacies with a close eye and not with a surrender eye.  
2. Freeing the mind from restrictions: The Qur'ans in circulation today, with their unified composition, may make the reader feel "complete understanding" and "finality of interpretation". Digital manuscripts, with their different drawings, free the mind from these constraints and open up horizons for questioning and reflection.  
3. Rediscovering hidden meanings: Going back to the original manuscripts can reveal subtle differences in painting, but these differences may carry with them deeper and more precise meanings, beyond superficial and direct meanings.  
4. Encourage personal reflection: digitizing manuscripts and transforming them into an interactive book that puts in the hands of each contemplative his own manuscript, shapes words according to his understanding, records his reflections, and shares them with others. Each contemplative person has his own manuscript, which enriches the field of Qur'anic reflection with multiple visions and understandings.  



 The Four Book Series: From Symbol to Reality  
This four-book series is not just a theoretical study, but a practical application of the digitization project. Each book in the series presents a different aspect of reflection through digital manuscripts, moving us from symbol to reality, from theory to application.  

1. Book 1: "Anwar al-Bayan fi Drawing the Ottoman Qur'an: Revealing the Secrets of the Tongue"  
   - It focuses on the linguistic and rhetorical aspects inherent in the drawing of the Ottoman Qur'an, and opens horizons for a deeper and more accurate understanding of the Holy Qur'an.  

• 2. Book Two: "New Rules for the Arabic Quranic Tongue: Deduction from the Qur'anic Text and Evidence of the Original Manuscripts" New Rules for the Qur'anic Arabic Tongue: We are not satisfied with the traditional grammatical and morphological rules, but we seek to derive new rules, derived from the Qur'anic text itself, using the original Qur'anic manuscripts as a witness to the manifestations of this tongue.

3. Book Three: "Contemplation in the Mirror of Drawings: Practical Applications of Digital Manuscripts in Contemplating the Qur'an"  
   - Provides practical and concrete applications of how to use digital manuscripts to understand the Holy Quran more deeply and comprehensively.  

4. Book IV: "New Concepts and Interactive Reflection: The Qur'an in the Age of Digitization and Digital Manuscripts"  
   - It aims to reconstruct the correct understanding of religion and life by introducing a series of new concepts that extend to various areas of life: religious, intellectual, social, and economic. It also encourages the use of modern technology, group interaction and digital knowledge collaboration.  



 Call to action  
These four books are a call to action, a call to optimism, and a call to participate in building a better future for Qur'anic contemplation and for serving the dear book of God. Let us make these digital manuscripts the starting point for a rich contemplative journey, in which we draw from the help of the pure Qur'an, draw inspiration from its clear gifts, and discover for ourselves the miracle of the Arabic tongue that was manifested in this eternal book.  



15. Detailing and development of the project  

 1. Vision and Goals: Redefining Reflection in the Digital Age  
- Preserving authenticity: highlighting the Qur'anic text in its form closest to the moment of revelation, while respecting historical efforts to understand it.  
- Responsible innovation: employing technology to open new horizons for management without deviating from Sharia controls.  

Proposed development:  
- Adding an interactive educational dimension through a digital platform that integrates original manuscripts with reliable scientific explanations "such as approved interpretations".  
- Strengthening partnerships with international manuscript centers (such as the Manuscript House in Sana'a or the El Escorial Library in Spain) to ensure the accuracy of digital models.  

 2. Methodology: From "Scientific Fasting" to "Cognitive Hajj"  
- Fasting phase "individual meditation":  
  - Designing digital tools that allow the administrator:  
    - Comparing manuscripts with copies of the Qur'an in circulation.  
    - Access to the explanations of previous scholars about the differences in Ottoman painting.  
    - Record personal notes in an encrypted "user-specific" space until the idea is mature.  
- Hajj phase "mass deployment":  
  - Create a refereed platform for the publication of mature measures after review by specialists in the sciences of the Qur'an.  
  - Organizing virtual panel discussions between practitioners and scientists to promote constructive dialogue.  

Proposed development:  
- Inclusion of a "cognitive staging system" that measures user progress through the stages of "beginner, intermediate, advanced" based on his interaction with the platform.  
- Linking the platform with Islamic research centers to enrich scientific content "such as the King Fahd Glorious Quran Complex".  

3. Sharia and technical controls: the balance between creativity and commitment  
- Doctrinal integrity guarantees: 
  - Enhancing the platform with algorithms that alert the user when approaching abnormal interpretations or contrary to the consensus of the interpreters.  
  - Providing a compact "reference library" containing the most important commentaries "such as al-Tabari, Ibn Kathir, al-Qurtubi" for guidance.  
- Technical Quality:  
 - Using  advanced OCR technology  to convert manuscripts into searchable texts while maintaining the accuracy of the Ottoman drawing.  
 - Apply  IIIF international standards for heritage digitization to ensure the platform's compatibility with global archives.  

4. Roadmap and recommendations  
1. Pilot phase:  
   - Launching a limited beta version in cooperation with Islamic universities "such as Al-Azhar University, the Islamic University of Madinah".  
   - Collect user feedback to develop interface and tools.  

2. Community Outreach:  
   - Producing a series of short videos explaining the philosophy of the project in simplified language "in Arabic, English, French".  
   - Organizing research competitions for young people on discovering new aspects of manuscripts.  

3. Sustainability:  
   - Adopt a funding model混合 that combines institutional support with symbolic subscriptions for researchers.  
 - Developing a version for the blind using Text-to-Speech technology  , taking into account the provisions of recitation.  



 Conclusion: Towards a Digital Managerial Renaissance  
"This project is not just a digital archive, it is a bridge between the legacy of the past and the consciousness of the present. As Sheikh Muhammad al-Ghazali said: "The Qur'an can only be understood with a contemplative heart, a mind that searches, and a renewed vigour." Let us work together to build a platform that will mirror the beauty of the Qur'an, preserve the nobility of our heritage, and drive an intellectual renaissance that restores the nation's leadership."  

  

In cooperation between technology and legitimacy, and between the individual and society, this project can make a shift in the understanding of the Holy Qur'an, and be the nucleus of a contemporary Islamic scientific movement.
16. Deeper detail of project development
1. Reviving authentic reflection:
• Emphasis on diversity:
o Digital manuscripts show that Qur'anic painting was not fully uniform at first, and this diversity opens the door to multiple readings and diversity of understandings. 
o This diversity does not mean chaos, and this problem is addressed by contemplation because God has preserved the remembrance and it is deduced after contemplation from the Qur'an
o  Rather, it is evidence of the richness of the Qur'anic text and its ability to protect itself from all distortion and destruction of all the additions to the manuscript, and the contemplative has one solution, which is diligence in contemplation to be able to touch the Qur'an and repair the verses that have been tampered with intentionally or unintentionally .
• Surface reading override:
o Digital manuscripts invite the contemplative to stop at every word, every letter, every difference in the drawing, to ask: Why was it written like this? And what is the possible meaning behind this difference?
o This distances the contemplative person from rapid machine reading, and urges him to meditate deeply.
• Back to roots:
o Digital manuscripts bring the contemplator back to the "first moment" of revelation, before layers of interpretation and human diligence accumulate on them.
o This does not mean canceling the interpretation, but rather that the contemplative person starts from the original text, and then uses the interpretations for a deeper understanding, not to start with the interpretations and end with them.
2. Tool for scientific research "deeper detail":
• Comparative analysis:
o The interactive digital manuscript allows the researcher to compare:
• Ottoman painting in various manuscripts.
• Ottoman painting with frequent readings.
• Ottoman painting with the opinions of drawing and control scholars.
o These comparisons can reveal linguistic, rhetorical and semantic secrets that were not previously clear.
• Statistics and Analysis:
o Digital tools can be used to count the number of times a word appears in a particular graphic and analyze the contexts in which it appears.
o This can help in a deeper understanding of word semantics and their evolution over time.
• Personal manuscript:
o Each scholar can create his own digital "manuscript", adding his comments, interpretations, links to other sources, and audio recordings of different interpretations of the Qur'an.
o This personal manuscript becomes a "laboratory" for research and reflection.
3. Platform for interaction and collaboration "deeper detail":
• Peer Review:
o The measures published on the platform are subject to a peer review, which other researchers evaluate and provide feedback.
o This ensures the quality of the published content and protects against anomalous interpretations.
• Specialized Panel Discussions:
o Virtual panel discussions can be organized on specific topics, such as:
• Differences in the drawing of the word "prayer" in manuscripts.
• The significance of drawing the small thousand in the Ottoman Qur'an.
• The impact of Ottoman painting on the understanding of the verses of rulings.
o These workshops bring together contemplators and scientists to share experiences and deepen understanding.
• Building a Knowledge Society:
o The platform becomes a "virtual community" for contemplators, where they share ideas, exchange questions, and collaborate on research.
o This community can include researchers from different disciplines (Quranic sciences, Arabic language, history, ...).
4. A bridge between the past and the present "deeper detail":
• Heritage Revival:
o The digitization of Quranic manuscripts is part of a larger project to revive and digitize Islamic heritage.
o This project includes the digitization of books of interpretation, hadith, jurisprudence, history, ...
• Technology at the Service of Revelation:
o The project shows that modern technology is not just tools for entertainment and communication, but can be a means of serving religion and science.
o This encourages Muslim youth to use technology for good.
• Rehabilitation of manuscripts:
o Quranic manuscripts are often confined to libraries and museums, and are only seen by specialists.
o Their digitization and public availability restores these precious treasures and makes them accessible to all.
5. Empowering the Mindful:
• Experience Control:
o The thoughtful can choose the manuscript he wants to study, determine the font size, change the colors, add tags, ...
o These tools make the reflection experience more comfortable and effective.
• Restricted autonomy:
o The project encourages the contemplative to think independently, but does not leave him alone in the face of the text.
o Digital tools provide him with access to interpretations and annotations, access to scholars' opinions, and communicate with other researchers.
• Safe environment for expression:
o The coded space for personal notes provides the mindful with a safe environment to express their thoughts and questions without fear of criticism or hasty judgments.
o This environment encourages creativity and thinking outside the box.
17. The title of our research today is the importance of the original digital manuscript and ways to deal with it


The original manuscript of the Qur'an is a special interactive and is not published until after the contemplator reaches the stages of certainty in research, reflection and gaining skills. In the stage of fasting should not publish his measures only at the time of Hajj when his measures have reached maturity in the stage of fasting and retreat be himself and learn and study contemplation and follow the old and new contemplators in the subject of management and collect data and I call it the scientific material that will benefit him in research and reflection. The subject that he manages does not eat what he ate the seven because it is forbidden for him to research a topic alone and did not take the research that was studied by scientists and researchers before him in the subject of his research. It should not start from scratch, it must start from what scientists have reached in the subject of his research and complete the research to add his mark and benefit humanity in what he has reached because he added something new from science 
The topic we are addressing is a profound methodology in the reflection of the Holy Quran and scientific research, with a focus on combining originality, innovation, and respect for the previous scientific heritage. Here is an analysis of the most prominent points you mentioned, with clarification of some legal and scientific aspects:

  Stages of reflection and scientific research:  
   - The stage of fasting and i'tikaf: similar to the stage of foundation and serious research, where the researcher is committed to scientific silence "not to rush to spread immature ideas", and studies the scientific material, and benefits from the efforts of previous scientists, as the Almighty said: ﴿Ask the people of remembrance if you do not know﴾ "bees: ". This is consistent with the methodology of scientific research, which rejects "starting from scratch" and emphasizes the need to build on the above.
   - Hajj stage "maturity": symbolizes the completion of research and the addition of new after scrutiny, where publication becomes useful to humanity, which recalls the saying of Imam Shafi'i: "Whoever rushes something prematurely will be punished by depriving it."

     .   Commitment to scientific heritage:  
   - The prohibition on "eating what the seven eat" is understood as a warning against singling out opinion without reference to reliable sources, which is what the scholars warn against, as Ibn Taymiyyah said: "Whoever abandons the plagiarism of what the predecessors have to do has left the right approach."
   - It is not permissible to neglect previous research in any subject, because science is cumulative, and God Almighty has vilified those who follow conjecture without knowledge: "If they follow only conjecture" "cattle: ".

     .   Scientific addition and innovation:  
   - The emphasis on "adding a new imprint" corresponds to the Islamic research on sincerity and mastery, as in the hadith: "Allah loves if one of you does a deed to master it" (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi). However, it is required that the addition be within the legal frameworks, without distorting the texts and deviating from harmony with the entire Qur'an. You must respect the context and multiply and read verses with verses because the Quran explains itself 
   - Interactive Digital Quran Manuscript:
IT IS USEFUL IN SEARCHING BECAUSE IT IS A DIGITAL MANUSCRIPT IN WORD  OR  PDF FORMAT  THAT HAS THE PROPERTY OF SEARCHING USING THE LETTER, WORD, OR WORD WALLS
A reading after the verses can be formed according to the understanding of the contemplative to memorize them, refer to them, remember them and study them
Add image symbols to the manuscript 
 If it is a metaphorical idea to contemplate the Qur'an with an interactive methodology, by consulting contemplators, their dialogue and discussion, and not departing from the fixed Qur'anic text. And write comments, notes, clarifications, thoughts, draft measures in the manuscript, and interpret words
Goal helps to remember 
   - Forbidden topics: Topics in which there is no legal evidence, or which are interpreted by personal opinion without evidence from the Qur'an.
   Balance between mind and transport:  
   - Contemplation is required in the Qur'an, but it must be in accordance with the controls of the Arabic tongue and to contemplate the Qur'an with open minds and conscious hearts, in order to draw from its help and be enlightened by its light, and walk on its guidance in our life in this world and the hereafter.


    Conclusion:
The methodology she describes is akin to "disciplined ijtihad" that combines a deep understanding of heritage with responsible innovation, which is what the Islamic world needs today to keep pace with contemporary challenges without compromising on constants. And Allah knows best.

18. "Reviving Contemplation in the Digital Age: A Vision for the Digitization of Qur'anic Manuscripts" "Updated and Expanded Version"
Introduction to "Appeal to Hearts and Minds":
Have you ever felt like reading the Holy Quran as if you were reading a book in a foreign language? Have you ever wondered about the deep meanings that hide behind words and letters? Did you long for the Qur'an to touch your heart, to light up your mind, and to change your life?
The Holy Qur'an, the eternal word of God, is a book of guidance and light, revealed by God Almighty to bring people out of darkness into light, and to guide them to the straight path. It is a book that carries with it the secrets of the universe and life, provides us with solutions to all our problems, and answers all our questions.
Same to you... Are we really interacting with the Qur'an as we should? Do we reflect on its verses, reflect on its meanings, and act on its rulings? Or did we settle for superficial reading, abstract recitation, and traditional understanding?
In our digital age, where the pace of life is accelerating, distractions are crowded, and minds are distracted, contemplation has become difficult, and the relationship with the Qur'an has become frosty and weak. Same to you... Does this mean to give up? Does this mean that we leave God's book abandoned?
Not!
The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts is born out of this challenge, offering us a new vision, a new hope, and a new way to revive reflection in the digital age. It is a project that holds good omens and invites us to a journey of faith and science to discover the treasures of the Holy Qur'an.
Problem: The decline of contemplation and the challenges of the age "detail and analysis":
• Surface reading:
o Reciting the Qur'an without understanding its meanings, and without trying to link its verses to reality.
o Reading becomes just a "habit" or "ritual," not a "worship" and "interaction."
• Stereotypical understanding:
o Relying on ready-made explanations, without activating the critical mind, and without trying to devise new meanings.
o Sufficiency with a single understanding of the verse, without realizing that the Qur'anic text bears multiple aspects of understanding.
• Separation from the original text:
o Stay away from the original Qur'anic manuscripts, which represent the closest image of the text as revealed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
o Lack of awareness of the importance of Ottoman painting, and the importance of differences in manuscripts.
• Challenges of the digital age:
o Distraction: The abundance of digital distractions (such as social media and electronic games) makes it difficult to focus on reflection.
o The spread of misinformation:  The ease with which information is disseminated on the Internet makes it difficult to distinguish between correct and wrong interpretations.
o Lack of specialized digital tools: Lack of digital tools specifically designed to help Muslims reflect.
o Poor good religious content: Lack of good and reliable religious content on the Internet, compared to entertainment or superficial content.
Solution: The project of digitizing Quranic manuscripts "a comprehensive vision":
The project of digitizing Quranic manuscripts is not just a technical project to convert ancient texts into digital texts, but rather an integrated civilized project, which aims to:
1. Availability of original text:

19. "Between Authenticity and Modernity: How do we balance heritage preservation with technology in understanding the Qur'an?" "Updated and extended version"
Introduction to "Problem and Question":
We live in an era of radical and rapid transformations, which poses new challenges in all aspects of our lives. Among these challenges is the challenge of balancing tradition and modernity, between preserving our identity, heritage and values, and between openness to the world and benefiting from scientific and technological developments.
This challenge is clearly manifested in our relationship with the Holy Qur'an, the eternal book of God, which He revealed as guidance to people, and a clear light. How can we maintain the authenticity of our understanding of the Qur'an, adhere to the rules of correct interpretation, and at the same time benefit from modern technology in the service of the Book of God, and in its understanding and management?
Are authenticity and modernity two opposites that do not meet? Or can they cooperate and complement? Can technology be a tool to revive heritage, rather than a means of obliterating it?
Originality: Solid roots "Detail and Clarify":
Authenticity in understanding the Holy Quran means:
1. Back to roots:
o Refer to the original sources for understanding the Qur'an "ancient Qur'anic manuscripts, frequent Qur'anic readings, sayings of the Companions and Taabi'een, and approved books of interpretation".
o Not only contemporary interpretations, but also refer to the first sources that witnessed the revelation and understood the Qur'anic text directly.
2. Respect for constants:
o Commitment to the legal controls in interpretation and interpretation, not to deviate from the consensus of the nation, and not to distort the Qur'anic text or interpret it mystically or symbolically.
o Believing that the Holy Qur'an is the infallible word of God, and that it is valid for all times and places.
3. Heritage Conservation:
o Preserving ancient Quranic manuscripts and protecting them from damage and loss.
o Transmitting the sciences of the Qur'an "such as the science of interpretation, the science of readings, and the science of drawing" to future generations, and maintaining the continuity of these sciences.
o Appreciating the efforts of previous scholars in serving the Book of Allah, and benefiting from their knowledge and experience.
4. Holistic understanding:
o Understanding the Holy Qur'an as an integrated unit, and not only understanding certain verses in isolation from their context.
o Linking the Qur'anic verses to the Sunnah of the Prophet, the Prophet's biography, and contemporary reality.
Contemporary: Conscious openness "elaboration and clarification":
Contemporary understanding of the Holy Qur'an means:
1. Employing technology:
o The use of modern digital tools "such as computers, the Internet, and smart phones" in the service of the Book of God, and in its understanding and management.
o Digitizing Quranic manuscripts, making them available to everyone online.
o Developing programs and applications that help to research the Qur'an, analyze its texts, and compare different interpretations.
2. Interaction with reality:
o Linking the verses of the Holy Qur'an to the issues and problems of the age, and providing Qur'anic solutions to these problems.
o Understanding the Holy Quran in the light of modern scientific and cognitive developments.
o Non-closure to oneself, openness to other cultures, and dialogue with people of different religions and philosophies.
3. Renewal and diligence:
o Renewal in understanding the Holy Qur'an, and deriving new meanings from the Qur'anic text, commensurate with the times and its requirements.
o Diligence in applying the provisions of the Holy Qur'an in contemporary reality, taking into account the change of time, place and conditions.
o Not to stagnate on traditional understanding, and to encourage critical thinking and creativity in understanding the Qur'an.
4. Communication with the other:
o Use modern media (such as the Internet, television, and radio) to disseminate a correct understanding of the Holy Qur'an and to familiarize non-Muslims with Islam.
o Participate in dialogues and discussions about the Holy Quran, and defend Islam with wisdom and good advice.
Complementarity, not contradiction: how do we combine tradition and modernity? "Methodology":
Authenticity and modernity are not contradictory, but can complement and cooperate in the service of understanding the Holy Qur'an. Modern technology can be a means of reviving heritage, rather than a means of obliterating it.
The proposed methodology for combining tradition and modernity:
1. Starting from originality:
o Our understanding of the Holy Qur'an must be based on authenticity, i.e. from original sources, and from Sharia regulations.
o We must reject any interpretation of the Qur'an that contradicts the consensus of the Ummah, violates linguistic rules, or contradicts common sense.
2. Employ technology wisely:
o We must use modern technology wisely and responsibly, and make it a tool to serve the Book of God, not the other way around.
o We must choose the right digital tools, use them correctly, and avoid over-reliance on them.
3. Disciplined renewal:
o We should encourage renewal in the understanding of the Holy Qur'an, but this renewal must be disciplined by Sharia controls, and based on sound evidence.
o We must differentiate between praiseworthy renewal and blameworthy renewal, as the first is the one that serves the Qur'anic text and clarifies its meanings, and the second is the one that distorts the Qur'anic text and takes it away from its purposes.
4. Constructive dialogue:
o We must encourage constructive dialogue between scholars and specialists in the sciences of the Qur'an, between contemplators and researchers, and between Muslims and non-Muslims.
o Dialogue must be based on mutual respect, on the pursuit of truth, and on adherence to the ethics of dialogue.
5. Education and awareness:
o We must educate future generations to love, contemplate and work with the Holy Qur'an.
o We must use all available means to raise awareness of the importance of the Qur'an, and of the importance of understanding and contemplating it.
Manuscript Digitization Project: A Model for Integration:
The project of digitizing Quranic manuscripts is a wonderful model of integration between tradition and modernity, it is:
• Maintains authenticity: by digitizing ancient Quranic manuscripts, and making them available to all.
• Employs technology: through the use of the latest digital technologies in the service of the Book of God.
• Encourages renewal: by providing advanced digital tools that help reflect and understand.
• Builds a knowledge society: by creating a digital platform that brings together thinkers, researchers and scientists.
Conclusion "Call to Action":
The real challenge is not to choose between tradition and modernity, but to combine them in a balanced and creative way. The contemporary Muslim is required to be rooted in his heritage, open to his time, and to use all available means to serve his religion and understand his book. The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts is an important step in this direction, and it is an invitation to every Muslim to participate in this journey of faith and science, the journey of discovering the treasures of the Holy Qur'an.

20. "Why the original manuscripts? The Importance of Returning to the Roots in Understanding the Qur'anic Text" "Updated and Expanded Version"
Introduction to "A Deprecating Question and a Motivating Question":
Have you ever thought, while reading the Holy Qur'an in the Qur'an printed in your hands, that this text that you recite has gone through a long journey through the centuries to reach you? Have you wondered what hands first wrote this text, what material they used, and what circumstances surrounded its writing?
The original Qur'anic manuscripts are the answer to these questions, and they are a living witness to the history of the Qur'anic text, and to the efforts of previous generations in preserving and transmitting it. They are not just old papers, but precious treasures, carrying with them secrets and meanings that we may not find in printed Qur'ans.
So why should we go back to these manuscripts? And what benefit will we gain from this? Is this return just an intellectual luxury, or is it a scientific and legitimate necessity?
The historical and scientific significance of the manuscripts "elaboration and clarification":
• The living memory of the Qur'anic text:
o The original Qur'anic manuscripts are as close as possible to the text revealed to the Prophet (peace be upon him), and they represent the "living memory" of this text, that is, they are the tangible physical witness that connects us to revelation.
o The printed Qur'ans we have today are copies of these manuscripts, so returning to the original means returning to the source.
• Witness the frequency:
o Qur'anic manuscripts scattered throughout the world, which vary in their history and illustration, confirm the frequency of the Qur'anic text, and that it has not been altered or altered over the centuries.
o This diversity of manuscripts "with their agreement in the main text" is evidence that the Holy Qur'an has been transmitted to us in multiple ways, which increases our confidence in its authenticity.
• Source of valuable information:
o Qur'anic manuscripts provide us with valuable information about:
• The history of collecting and codifying the Qur'an: How the Qur'an was compiled during the reign of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq - may God be pleased with him, and how it was written and its copies were unified during the reign of Othman bin Affan - may God be pleased with him.
• History and development of Ottoman painting: How Ottoman painting developed over the centuries, and what are the differences in painting between different manuscripts.
• Differences in Quranic readings: How did Quranic readings differ, and what is the relationship between these differences and Ottoman painting.
• Opinions of drawing and control scholars: What are the opinions of drawing and control scholars in directing differences in Ottoman painting?
• History and types of Qur'ans: What types of Qur'ans existed in different eras, and what are the characteristics of each type.
• History of Arabic Calligraphy: How Arabic calligraphy developed over the centuries, and what types of calligraphy were used in writing the Qur'an.
• History of paper, ink and writing instruments: What types of paper, ink and writing tools were used in writing the Qur'an.
• History of decoration and gilding: how decoration and gilding in the Qur'an developed through the centuries.
Practical benefits of returning to manuscripts as "concrete examples":
• A deeper understanding of Ottoman painting:
o Quranic manuscripts help us understand the secrets of Ottoman painting, and the wisdom of writing some words in a certain way.
o Example: Why is the word "prayer" written in Waw instead of Alif in some places? We may find in ancient manuscripts that this drawing has to do with the etymology, different readings, or certain rhetorical connotations.
• More accurate interpretation of the differences in readings:
o Qur'anic manuscripts help us understand the reasons for differences in Qur'anic readings, and how these differences affect meaning.
o Example: Why did some readers read the word "King of the Day of Judgment" by breaking the meem and soothing the lam "king", and others read it by opening the meme and then wrote "Malik"? We may find in ancient manuscripts that both readings are correct, and that each reading adds a new dimension to the understanding of the verse.
• Discovering new meanings:
o Qur'anic manuscripts may reveal new meanings that were not clear before, by contemplating the Ottoman painting, comparing it with different readings, and referring to linguistic sources and interpretations.
o For example, we may find in an ancient manuscript that the word "path" is written in sin instead of sad, and this may indicate the meaning of ease and ease in following the path of guidance.
• Enhancing the certainty of the authenticity of the text:
o A return to Qur'anic manuscripts reinforces our certainty that the Qur'anic text is authentic and that it has not undergone any change or distortion over the centuries.
o Seeing ancient manuscripts with our eyes, and touching them with our hands "if possible", increases our connection to the Qur'an, and makes us feel closer to the age of prophecy.
• Discovery of rhetorical subtleties: 
Manuscripts may reveal rhetorical subtleties in the Qur'anic text that were not clear in printed Qur'ans, such as the way words are distributed on the page, or the way some letters are colored.
• Understanding the historical context:
o The study of manuscripts helps to understand the historical and social context in which the verses were revealed, which helps to have a deeper understanding of their meanings.
Call for interest in manuscripts "practical steps":
Returning to Qur'anic manuscripts is not just an intellectual luxury, but a scientific and legitimate necessity, and a duty for every Muslim interested in the Book of God. We must:
1. We care about Quranic manuscripts found in libraries, museums and research centers around the world.
2. We are working to digitize these manuscripts, and make them available to researchers, intellectuals and the general Muslim public.
3. We encourage studies and research based on Qur'anic manuscripts.
4. We educate future generations to love and care for manuscripts, and to introduce them to their value and importance.
5. We support projects aimed at preserving and restoring manuscripts.
6. We establish museums and exhibitions of Qur'anic manuscripts to introduce the public to this great heritage.
Manuscript Digitization Project: A Step in the Right Direction:
The project of digitizing Quranic manuscripts is an important step in the right direction, as it is:
• Easy access to manuscripts: Makes Quranic manuscripts available to everyone, anytime, anywhere.
• Provides tools for research and analysis: Provides advanced digital tools that help study and analyze manuscripts.
• Encourages reflection: Encourages reflection in the Qur'an, by returning to the original text.
• Builds a community of knowledge: Builds a community of contemplators and researchers, working together to serve the Book of God.
Conclusion "Call to Action":
The original Qur'anic manuscripts are a precious treasure, which we must preserve and use to understand the Book of our Lord. A return to these manuscripts is a return to the roots, a necessary step to revive reflection in the digital age. It is an invitation to every Muslim to meditate on the Book of Allah, reflect on its verses, discover its secrets, and make the Qur'an the spring of his heart, the light of his chest, the clarity of his sadness, and the departure of his concern.

21. "From Fasting to Hajj: Stages of Reflection in the Interactive Digital Manuscript" 
Introduction to "spiritual metaphor":
True reflection on the Holy Qur'an is not just a passing reading of words, or a quick recitation of letters, but a deep journey of faith, requiring deliberation, reflection, interaction, effort, patience and perseverance. It is like a blessed pilgrimage, which begins with ihram and talbiyah, and ends with tawaaf, saa'i and decomposition.
The Qur'anic Manuscript Digitization Project not only offers advanced digital tools, but also proposes a step-by-step methodology for reflection, inspired by this spiritual journey, and divided into stages resembling the rituals of Hajj, to make the most of the authentic Qur'anic text, and to reach a deeper and more solid understanding.
Analogy with rituals: Why fast and pilgrimage? "Detail and clarification":
• Fasting:
o It represents the stage of purification, purification and renunciation, where the contemplative is cut off from worldly distractions, and accepts the Holy Qur'an with a pure heart and an open mind.
o Fasting is "constipation" from everything that distracts from contemplation, whether it is food, drink, words or negative thoughts.
o Fasting is a "focus" on the Qur'anic text alone, its meanings and connotations.
• Hajj:
o It represents the stage of maturity, meeting and sharing, where the contemplative meets others "scientists and contemplators", shares his ideas, benefits from their experiences, and spreads what he has learned.
o Hajj is a "journey" to the Sacred House of God, and contemplation is a "journey" to the meanings of the Holy Qur'an.
o Hajj is a "gathering" of Muslims from everywhere, and contemplation is a "gathering" of ideas and opinions about the Qur'an.
Stages of reflection: a gradual journey towards deep understanding "elaboration and clarification":
1. Fasting phase "preparation and deep individual meditation":
o Concentration and isolation:
• The contemplative begins his journey by focusing on the Qur'anic text in the digital manuscript, moving away from worldly distractions (such as social media, news, and phone calls), ready-made interpretations "except in cases of necessity", and from prejudices.
• He chooses a quiet and comfortable place, a suitable time when his mind is clear, and allocates enough time to reflect "it may be an hour or more, depending on his ability."
o Digital utilities:
• Enlarge text and change colors: to make it easier to read, make text clearer, and to relieve eye strain.
• Search feature: to focus on specific words or phrases, search for their repetition in other places in the Qur'an, and to understand the general context of the verse.
• Record personal notes: In a private encrypted space (such as Evernote,  OneNote, or a Word document), to record ideas, questions, thoughts, initial inferences, linking verses, and practical benefits.
• Listen to different recitations: to compare the readings "if the contemplative has knowledge of the readings", reflect on the melody and rhythm, and to improve the recitation.
• Access to interpretations "in a limited way": to use them to understand strange words or difficult structures, or to find out the reasons for the descent, but not to rely on them completely to understand the meaning.
• The use of linguistic dictionaries: to understand the meanings of words more accurately, and to know their origins and derivations.
o Objective:
• Dive into the depths of the Qur'anic text, and understand it personally and directly, as if the contemplative reads the Qur'an for the first time.
• The formation of the "seed" of contemplation, that is, the initial idea or deduction, which will grow and develop in the next stages.
• Purifying the heart and mind from impurities and negative thoughts, and preparing them to receive the light and guidance of the Qur'an.
• Build a strong personal relationship with the Holy Quran.
o Methodology:
• Careful reading: reading verses slowly and thoughtfully, stopping at each word and every letter, and not moving on to the next verse until after understanding the previous verse.
• Questioning: Ask questions about verses, such as:
• Why did Allah say this?
• What does this mean?
• What is the wisdom of this command or prohibition?
• How does this relate to the before and after?
• What is the lesson learned from this verse?
• How can I apply this verse in my life?
• Reflection: Reflection on the meanings of verses, their connotations, and their various dimensions "linguistic, rhetorical, doctrinal, jurisprudential, and moral".
• Linking to reality: Trying to link verses to contemporary reality, personal life, and current events.
• Being influenced by the Qur'an: Interacting with verses with a humbled heart, a teary eye, and working limbs.
• Supplication: Praying that Allah will open to the contemplative of his conquests, and bless him with understanding of his book, and make him one of the people of the Qur'an.
o Warning:
• Avoid spreading ideas at this stage before they mature, and settle for personal reflection and private recording.
• Not to assert the validity of any understanding before verifying it, and not to be fanatic about personal opinion.
• Do not give in to obsessions or negative thoughts that may discourage reflection.
• Not comparing oneself with others in reflection, as everyone has their own abilities and understanding.
2. Maturity stage "consultation and review":
o Gradual transition: After a sufficient period of individual meditation "may take days, weeks, or months, depending on the nature of the verses and the level of the contemplator, and according to God's reconciliation," the contemplative feels that the "seed" of contemplation has begun to grow and bloom, that his thoughts have become clearer and more mature, and that he has something useful to offer others.
o Consultation:
• The contemplative person presents his ideas and reflections to scholars and specialists in the sciences of the Qur'an, to benefit from their expertise, obtain their guidance, and ensure the correctness of his understanding.
• Scientists can be contacted through a digital platform "such as a Q&A section, live broadcast, or specialized forums."
• Scientists can also communicate in reality "such as attending their lessons, or visiting them in their councils."
• Scholars who are known for their knowledge, piety and piety, and who adhere to the approach of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah in interpretation should be selected.
o Review:
• The contemplative person reviews his measures in the light of the scholars' directives, modifies what needs to be modified, deletes what needs to be deleted, and adds to them what needs to be added.
• Ensure that his measures do not contradict the consensus of the Ummah, do not violate linguistic or legal rules, and do not include any distortions or esoteric interpretations.
• He ensures that his contemplations are based on authentic evidence from the Qur'an, Sunnah and the sayings of the righteous predecessors.
• He reviews the sources he used, and verifies their validity and reliability.
3. Hajj phase "Hermetic Publishing and Collective Participation":
o Full maturity: After consultation and review, the contemplative feels that his management has reached full maturity, that it is ready to share with others, and that it can benefit other Muslims.
o Tools:
• Peer Review: The deliberative presents his or her reflections to other researchers "through the digital platform" to evaluate them and provide feedback on them "Peer Review". This process ensures the quality of the measures and helps to develop and improve them.
• Refereed deployment: After successfully passing the peer review stage, the measures are published on the digital platform, to be available to everyone, and to benefit as many people as possible.
• Participation in panel discussions:  The thinker joins virtual panel discussions on reflection topics, shares his opinions and ideas, listens to the opinions of others, and interacts with them.
• Communicating with the community: The contemplator interacts with the digital community of thinkers, exchanges experiences and knowledge with them, shares their interests, benefits from them and benefits them.
• Virtual workshops: Participation in virtual workshops aimed at developing the skills of managers and exchanging experiences.
o Objective:
• Exchanging ideas and experiences with others, and expanding the circle of knowledge.
• Deepen understanding through dialogue and discussion, and through exposure to different perspectives.
• Building a community of collaborative contemplators, who work together to serve the Book of God.
• Spreading interest among people, and delivering goodness to the largest possible number of Muslims.
• Contribute to the revival of reflection in the nation.
o Etiquette:
• Commitment to the etiquette of dialogue and discussion, non-fanaticism of opinion, and respect for the opinions of others.
• Humility and lack of arrogance, not claiming infallibility or perfection.
• Seeking the truth, not triumphing for oneself.
• Devotion to God Almighty in word and deed, and in order to please Him.
• Pray that God will accept this work, and make it pure for His honorable face.
Transition between stages "Dynamic of reflection":
• Flexibility: There is no strict "dividing line" between the stages, but the contemplator can move between them freely according to his need, according to the nature of the verses he contemplates, and according to God's success for him. He may return to the stage of "fasting" after starting the "Hajj" phase, if he needs more reflection and reflection, or if he discovers a mistake in his understanding.
• Gradual: It is recommended to start with the "fasting" phase, then gradually move to the "maturity" stage, and then to the "Hajj" stage. But this is not a prerequisite, as some may start with the "Hajj" phase if they have a strong scientific background, or if they reflect on verses that they have already contemplated before.
• Integration: The three stages are complementary, and none of them are indispensable. Fasting feeds Hajj, Hajj enriches fasting, and maturity is the bridge between them. The aim of these stages is to reach real reflection that affects the heart, mind and behavior.
Practical examples:
• Consider the verse of the Kursi:
o Fasting: reading the verse carefully, repeating it, reflecting on every word in it, and recording thoughts and thoughts.
o Maturity: Refer to the approved interpretations, know the sayings of the scholars in the interpretation of the verse, and review personal measures in light of this.
o Hajj: Sharing measures with others, discussing them, and benefiting from their opinions.
• Consider a short surah "like Surat Al-Asr":
o Fasting: Reading the surah several times, trying to understand its overall meaning, and determining the main theme of the surah.
o Maturity: Dividing the surah into sections, contemplating each passage separately, and referring to the interpretations to understand the strange words.
o Hajj: Writing an article on the management of the surah, publishing it on the platform, and participating in panel discussions on the surah.
Conclusion to "An Invitation to Reflect":
The methodology of "From Fasting to Hajj" is a call for a deep, responsible and systematic reflection of the Holy Qur'an. It combines individual reflection and collective participation, tradition and modernity, science and faith. It is a journey of faith and science, starting with isolation and reflection, ending with participation and publication, passing through the stage of maturity and consultation. It is a journey that aims to make the most of the Book of God, and to build a generation of conscious contemplators, who are able to understand the Qur'an and apply it in their lives, who are able to face the challenges of the times, and contribute to building a better future. for the Islamic Ummah.

• Choose the right tool: Choose the digital tool that best suits your goal. If you want to search for a specific word, use the search tool. If you want to compare different manuscripts, use the comparison tool.
• Use tools intelligently: Don't rely entirely on digital tools, use them as reflective aids. Remember that true reflection is a work of the heart, mind, and soul.
• Don't rush the results: reflection takes time, effort and patience. Don't rush the results, and don't stop looking and meditating.
• Consult scientists: If you have difficulty understanding a particular verse, or if you have a question on a particular topic, do not hesitate to consult scientists and specialists.
Conclusion:
The digital tools provided by the Qur'anic Manuscript Digitization Project are keys to a deeper and more effective reflection on the Book of God. They are tools that enable us to communicate with the authentic Qur'anic text, to better understand it, and to apply it in our lives. But we must always remember that technology is just a means, and that the end is a true reflection that touches hearts and minds, and changes behavior and morality.

23. "Peer Review and Refereed Publishing: Quality Assurance in Digital Measures" "Updated and Expanded Version"
Introduction:
In the digital age, where publishing has become accessible to all, and where true and false information competes to attract readers' attention, it is important to ensure the quality of published content, especially when it comes to interpreting the Holy Quran and contemplating its verses. The project of digitization of Quranic manuscripts pays great attention to this issue, and adopts strict mechanisms to ensure the quality of digital measures published on its platform, on top of these mechanisms: peer review and refereed publishing.
Why quality and reliability? "Importance"
• Protection of the Qur'anic text: The Holy Qur'an is the infallible word of God, and it must be protected from wrong or abnormal interpretations, which may mislead people and divert them from correct understanding.
• Enhance trust: Ensuring the quality of published measures enhances users' confidence in the platform, and encourages them to interact with and benefit from it.
• Building a scientific reference: Refereed and reviewed measures become a reliable scientific reference for researchers and contemplators.
• Development of scientific research: Peer review contributes to the development of scientific research in the field of reflection, by providing observations and recommendations to improve the quality of measures.
• Preventing chaos and extremism: Quality assurance prevents the spread of chaos in interpretation, and protects against extreme or deviant interpretations.
• Legitimate responsibility: Publishing the right measures is a legitimate responsibility that falls on the shoulders of those in charge of the project, as science is a trust.
 Peer Review: what is it? and how is it done?
Peer review is a process of scientific evaluation of the measures submitted for publication, carried out by researchers specialized in Quranic sciences (called "reviewers" or "arbitrators"), to ensure their quality, validity and suitability for publication.
Peer Review Mechanism in the Manuscript Digitization Project:
1. Reflection Submission:  The Administrator submits his reflection to the digital platform, through a dedicated form.
2. Pre-selection:  The editorial team at the platform conducts a preliminary examination of the reflection, to ensure that it falls within the scope of the project, and that it is written in proper language.
3. Selection of reviewers : If the reflection passes the initial examination, two or more researchers specialized in Quranic sciences (preferably experienced in the field of manuscripts) are selected to review the reflection.
o Criteria for selecting reviewers:
• Scientific experience in the field of Quranic sciences.
• Good academic reputation.
• Commitment to Sharia controls in interpretation.
• Impartiality and objectivity.
4. Review and evaluation: Each reviewer independently evaluates the reflection, based on specific criteria, and submits a detailed report that includes:
o Strengths: Positive aspects of reflection (such as originality, innovation, and linguistic accuracy).
o Weaknesses: Areas that need improvement "such as scientific errors, lack of clarity of ideas, or poor evidence."
o Recommendations: Specific suggestions for better reflection "such as adding references, clarifying points, or paraphrasing phrases."
o Overall Rating: Overall reflection assessment (e.g. "Accepted for publication", "Accepted for publication after modification", "Rejected"".
5. Decision Making: Based on the reviewers reports, the editorial team makes a decision on the publication of the measure:
o Accepted for publication: If the reflection meets quality standards, it is published on the platform.
o Accepted for publication after modification: If the reflection needs some minor modifications, it is sent to the owner to make the required modifications, and then published after confirming that the modifications have been made.
o Rejected: If the contemplation does not meet quality standards, if it involves serious scientific errors, or if it contradicts Sharia controls, its publication is rejected.
Criteria for evaluating measures:
• Compliance with Sharia Regulations:
o Not to violate the consensus of the nation.
o Do not deviate from linguistic rules.
o Non-esoteric or symbolic interpretation of the Qur'anic text.
o Not to interpret by abstract opinion without relying on legitimate evidence.
• Scientific Accuracy:
o The correctness of the information contained in the reflection.
o Based on reliable sources.
o No linguistic or spelling errors.
• Originality and innovation:
o That contemplation provides a new addition to the understanding of the verse.
o Reflection should be the result of personal effort, not just transmission from other sources.
• Clarity and order:
o The reflection should be written in a clear and understandable language.
o Ideas should be organized and organized.
o Contemplation should be easy to read and understand.
• Evidence:
o The reflection should be based on evidence and proofs from the Qur'an, Sunnah and the sayings of scholars.
o The evidence must be strong and convincing.
Hermetic publishing: what is it? And what is its use?
Refereed publication is the publication of measures that have successfully passed the peer review stage on the digital platform, so that they are available to all.
Benefits of Hermetic Deployment:
• Quality Assurance: Ensure that the published measures are of high quality, based on sound scientific and methodological foundations.
• Building trust: Building users' confidence in published content, and encouraging them to interact with it.
• Enrich content: Add new and innovative measures to the platform, enriching the content available to administrators.
• Encourage research: Encourage more and improve the quality of the measures.
• Formation of reference: Formation of a reliable scientific reference for Quranic reflections.
Hermetic Publication Mechanism:
1. Final Review: After making the required adjustments (if any), the editorial team conducts a final review of the reflection to ensure that it meets all the requirements.
2. Publication:  The reflection is published on the digital platform, in the section dedicated to it "such as the section "Contemplation of verses"".
3. Classification: Contemplation is categorized by topic "e.g. doctrine, jurisprudence, ethics" for easy access.
4. Comments: Other users can comment on the thought posted, ask questions, and provide feedback "while adhering to the etiquette of dialogue."
5. Update: The person who has the introspection can update his management based on the feedback and feedback he receives, or based on his discovery of new information.
The importance of transparency:
• Reviewer names:  Reviewers' names are disclosed "after their approval" to enhance transparency and confidence in the audit process.
• Audit reports: Audit reports can be made available "after deleting personal information" to administrators, to see the reasons for accepting or rejecting the measure.
Conclusion:
Peer review and refereed publication are essential processes to ensure the quality of digital measures and to protect the Qur'anic text from misinterpretations. They are an essential part of the Qur'anic manuscript digitization project, and aim to build a responsible and collaborative scientific community, and to provide reliable and high-quality content to practitioners and researchers around the world.

24. "Differences in Ottoman Painting: Semantic Treasures Awaiting Discovery" "Updated and Expanded Version"
Introduction:
The Ottoman drawing of the Holy Quran is not just a way of writing words, but a unique writing system that carries with it semantic, linguistic and rhetorical dimensions that go beyond the usual spelling drawing. Some may think that the differences in drawing between ancient Qur'anic manuscripts are just copyist errors or worthless formal differences, but the truth goes far beyond that. These differences, often, are intentional signs, hidden symbols, and gates for a deeper and more accurate understanding of the meanings of the Qur'an. They are "semantic treasures" waiting Who has the keys to contemplation to reveal them.
What is Ottoman painting? And why is it important?
• Definition: Ottoman painting is the way in which the Qur'an was written during the reign of Caliph Othman bin Affan, may God be pleased with him, when the Holy Qur'an was compiled and its copies were standardized.
• Important:
o Preserving the text: Ottoman painting is an essential part of preserving the Qur'anic text from distortion or alteration.
o Frequency: Ottoman painting has been transmitted to us repeatedly from generation to generation, just like the Qur'anic text itself.
o Quranic readings: Ottoman painting is closely related to frequent Quranic readings, as many differences in painting are explained by differences in readings.
o Hidden connotations: Ottoman painting carries with it rhetorical and linguistic connotations and signs that may not be evident in modern spelling painting.
Sections of differences in Ottoman painting:
Variations of Ottoman painting can be divided into several main sections:
1. Deletion: Deleting some letters from the word "such as deleting the thousand from the word "prayer"".
2. Increase: Increase some letters in the word "such as increasing the thousand after the waw in the word "they said"".
3. Wildcard: Substituting one letter with another "such as writing yaa alpha in the word "yahya"".
4. Connecting and separation: Connecting some words to each other or separating them from each other, such as connecting "that" with "not" in the word "no"".
5. Change the shape of the letter: Change the shape of some letters "such as the shape of the distraction or the thousand compartment".
6. Different positions of dots: Different positions of dots in some letters "such as "you know" and "they know"".
Examples of variations in drawing and their possible connotations "with expansion":
• The word "prayer":
o "Prayer" is sometimes written in waw instead of alif.
o Possible connotations "in addition to the above":
• Reference to the origin of the word: The origin of the word is said to be from "saloo", which is a sweat in the back that moves when praying.
• Alerting to the importance of prayer: Waw indicates plurality and multitude, as if prayer brings together all the best.
• Linking to supplication: Waw may also refer to supplication, as prayer is a supplication and a request from God.
• Small thousand in some words:
o The small alif is written above some letters "such as "Rahman"".
o Possible connotations "in addition to the above":
• Pronunciation alert: The small alif is pronounced and not written in the standard Ottoman drawing, and this reminds the reader of the need for correct pronunciation.
• Reference to a special meaning: A small thousand may indicate that this word has a special meaning that deserves contemplation, such as the vast mercy in the word "Merciful."
• Differentiate between words: In some cases, the small thousand may be used to differentiate between two similar words in the drawing (such as "owner" and "king").
• Yaa that writes alpha:
o Yaa alpha is written in some words "such as "Yahya"".
o Possible connotations "in addition to the above":
• Reference to the etymology: A thousand may indicate that the etymology of the word is from "life".
• Alert to a special meaning: A thousand may indicate that this word has a special meaning related to life, such as eternal life in the afterlife.

• Increase the thousand after the Waw:
o The thousand is increased after the waw in some words "such as "they said"".
o Possible connotations:
• Emphasis on the act: A thousand may indicate the affirmation of the occurrence of the act from the group.
• Word separation: You may use alif to separate two words that are connected in pronunciation.
• Proportionality to the endowment: In some cases, the increase of a thousand may be proportional to the endowment on the word.
• Delete the thousand from the word "hurry":
o You may write "hurry" without a thousand after the waw.
o Possible connotations: 
Super speed: Omission of a thousand may indicate the super speed required in response to God'  s command.No hesitation: Deletion may indicate not hesitating or delaying in rushing to good.
• Variation in the shape of the letter "distraction":  The shape of the letter "distraction" may differ in some words. Possible connotations:
• The word "God": The form of distraction in the word majesty may carry special connotations related to invisibility and divine greatness. Other words: The variation of the form of distraction in other words may have to do with readings or context.
How to take advantage of the differences in drawing? "Methodology of reflection":
1. Reflection and questioning: stopping at each difference in the drawing, and wondering about its possible cause and significance. Why was the word written this way? What is the difference between this drawing and the usual spell drawing?
2. Comparison: Comparing drawing in different manuscripts, comparing it with drawing in circulating Qur'ans, and comparing it with frequent Qur'anic readings.
3. Refer to sources: Refer to reliable sources, such as:
o Drawing and control books: such as Abu Amr al-Dani's al-Muqni' and al-Tabari's al-Tibyan.

The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts provides us with a unique opportunity to return to these treasures, and to benefit from them in a deeper and more accurate understanding of the Book of God. It is an invitation to every Muslim to meditate on the Book of Allah, reflect on its verses, and discover its secrets.

25. "Case Study: How Can Digital Manuscript Change Our Understanding of Surat Al-Fatihah?" "Updated and extended version"
Introduction:
Surat Al-Fatihah, the Mother of the Book and the Seven Mathani, is the greatest surah in the Holy Qur'an. We read it in every rak'ah of our prayers, and we repeat it on many occasions. But have we ever delved into understanding every word and every letter in it? Have we wondered about the wisdom of drawing some of its words in a certain shape in the ancient Ottoman Qur'an? The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts opens the door to a unique opportunity to re-read Al-Fatihah and discover its hidden semantic treasures by studying high-resolution digital manuscripts.
Scientific methodology for studying Al-Fatihah using the digital manuscript:
1. Manuscript Selection:
o Choose a high-resolution digital manuscript for Surat Al-Fatihah, preferably from ancient Ottoman manuscripts "such as the Sana'a manuscript, the Topkapi manuscript, the manuscript of Al-Mashhad Al-Husseini".
o Choose multiple scripts for comparison.
2. Accurate visual comparison:
o Comparing the drawing of words in the digital manuscript with the drawing in the Qur'an currently in circulation "such as the Qur'an of the Prophet's City".
o Identify differences in the drawing "if any", such as:
• Delete or increment a character.
• Replace one letter with another.
• Change the shape of the character.
• Different positions of dots.
• Connecting and separating words.
3. Linguistic and semantic analysis:
o Analysis of differences in drawing in linguistic and semantic terms.
o Refer to drawing and tuning books (such as Dani's The Masked) to see how drawing scholars guide these differences.
o Refer to language books "such as "Lisan Al Arab"" to know the origins of words and their different meanings.
4. Linking to Quranic readings:
o Linking the differences in drawing to the frequent Qur'anic readings of Surat Al-Fatihah.
o Find out whether the difference in drawing leads to a difference in reading, and whether this difference affects the meaning.
5. Use of approved interpretations:
o Refer to the approved commentaries (such as that of al-Tabari, Ibn Kathir, and al-Qurtubi) to understand the verses in light of the differences in the drawing.
o Find out whether the commentators pointed out these differences in the drawing, and what was their direction towards them.
6. Meditation and reflection:
o After gathering information from different sources, it comes into play and reflect on the possible meanings of differences in painting.
o Try to derive new meanings or additional dimensions to understand the surah.
7. Recording results:
o Record the findings in the personal digital manuscript, linking them to the sources used.
Hypothetical examples of changing understanding through the digital manuscript:
• "King of the Day of Judgment":
o Difference in drawing:  We may find that the word "king" is written without a thousand after the meme in some Ottoman manuscripts "king".
o Review:
• This drawing corresponds to Malak's reading of "breaking the meme and soothing the lam", which is a frequent reading.
• Reading "Malak" indicates that God Almighty is the disposer on the Day of Judgment, and the one who forbids it.
• Reading "Malik" indicates that Allah Almighty is the owner of the Day of Judgment.
o Influence on comprehension: Both readings are correct, and each adds a new dimension to the understanding of the verse. Reading "Malak" may make us feel more the greatness and authority of God Almighty on the Day of Judgment.
• "The Straight Path":
o Difference in drawing: We may find that the word "Sirat" is written in Sin instead of Sad in some manuscripts "Sirat".
o Review:
• This drawing corresponds to the frequent reading of the Sarat in Seine.
• Reading "Sirat" in Sin may indicate the meaning of ease and ease in following the path of guidance.
• Reading the "path" with the sad may indicate the meaning of righteousness, strength and steadfastness in the truth.
o Influence on comprehension: Both readings are correct, and each adds a new dimension to the understanding of the verse. Reading "Sirat" may encourage us to follow the path of guidance, and remind us that it is an easy and easy path for those who want to follow it.
• Commas between words:
o Difference: We may notice a difference in the positions of separators between words and sentences in the manuscript compared to printed Qur'ans.
o Review:
• This difference may have to do with the endowment and the beginning of recitation.
• It may refer to different divisions of meanings within a single verse.
o Impact on comprehension:
• This difference may help us better understand the rhythm of the surah.
o It may draw our attention to new relationships between words and sentences that we did not pay attention to before.
The importance of this study:
• Rediscovering Al-Fatihah: This study helps us rediscover Surat Al-Fatihah, as if we were reading it for the first time.
• Deepening understanding: It helps us to understand the meanings of the surah more deeply and accurately.
• Appreciation of Ottoman painting: It makes us appreciate the value of Ottoman painting and its importance in understanding the Holy Quran.
• Encouraging reflection: It encourages us to reflect on the Holy Qur'an in general, and not to be satisfied with superficial reading.
• Emphasizing the importance of the digitization project: Emphasizes the importance of the manuscript digitization project in reviving the sciences of the Qur'an.
Conclusion:
The case study of Surat Al-Fatihah using the digital manuscript is just one example of how this project can change our understanding of the Holy Quran. It is a call for every Muslim to benefit from this valuable tool and to reflect on the Book of God more deeply and authentically. It is an endless journey of discovery, the deeper we contemplate the Qur'an, the more we discover new treasures, and the more certain we are of the greatness of this immortal book.

The role of Qur'anic manuscripts in understanding and applying Qur'anic concepts:
The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts plays an important role in understanding and applying Qur'anic concepts, through:
• Rooting concepts: Quranic manuscripts take us back to the original text of the Holy Qur'an, which helps us to understand Qur'anic concepts more accurately and deeply, away from misinterpretations or distortions.
• Renewing understanding: Qur'anic manuscripts may reveal new meanings in Qur'anic concepts that we did not pay attention to before, by contemplating the Ottoman drawing, or by comparing different readings.
• Linking concepts to reality: Qur'anic manuscripts help us connect Qur'anic concepts to contemporary reality, by understanding the historical and social context in which the verses were revealed.
• Providing tools for research and analysis:  The digitization project provides advanced tools for research and analysis, which help us extract, analyze, and apply Quranic concepts from the text.
Practical examples:
• The concept of "Shura":
o Challenge: The absence of consultation in some societies, and tyranny of opinion.
o The role of manuscripts: By studying the verses that talk about shura in manuscripts, we may discover new dimensions of this concept, such as the importance of shura in all areas of life "not only in politics", and the importance of the participation of all members of society in shura.
• The concept of "justice":
o Challenge: The spread of injustice and corruption in many societies.

30. "The Future of Quranic Contemplation: The Role of Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies" "Updated and Expanded Edition"
Introduction:
Today, our world is witnessing a tremendous technological revolution, changing the face of life in all fields. Among these developments, artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies are emerging as driving forces for innovation, opening up new horizons that were previously unimaginable. But what impact do these developments have on our relationship with the Qur'an? Can technology help us understand the Book of God more deeply and effectively? The Qur'anic Manuscript Digitization Project seeks to foresee the future of Qur'anic reflection, and to explore how artificial intelligence and emerging technologies can To serve this noble goal.
Artificial Intelligence: A Revolution in the Understanding of Religious Texts:
Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science, which aims to develop systems and programs capable of simulating human mental abilities, such as learning, deduction, problem solving, natural language understanding, and pattern recognition. In the field of understanding religious texts, artificial intelligence can revolutionize real by:
• Analysis of Qur'anic texts in an unprecedented way:
o Speed and accuracy:  AI can analyze Quranic texts (including digital manuscripts) with speed and precision, far beyond the capacity of humans.
o Comprehensiveness:  AI can analyze the entire Qur'anic text, not just parts of it, helping to understand the relationships between different verses and surahs.
o Pattern detection: AI can detect linguistic, rhetorical, and semantic patterns in the Qur'anic text, which may not be obvious to traditional researchers.
o Identify relationships: AI can identify relationships between words, phrases and verses, and between historical and social verses and contexts.
• Generate new insights into the Qur'anic text:
o Suggest meanings:  AI can suggest possible meanings for ambiguous or controversial words and phrases, based on context analysis, similar texts, linguistic sources and interpretations.
o Identify topics:  AI can identify the main and sub-topics in the Qur'anic text, and classify verses by these topics.
o Deriving rulings: Artificial intelligence (AI) "with the help of Sharia experts" can help deduce Sharia rulings from the Qur'anic text, by analyzing relevant verses and determining their implications.
o Detecting miracles: Artificial intelligence can help uncover aspects of scientific, linguistic and rhetorical miracles in the Holy Quran.
• Personalizing the reflection experience:
o Understanding user needs:  AI can understand each user's needs, level of knowledge, and interests by analyzing their interaction with the platform.
o Suggest the right content:  AI can suggest content that is appropriate for each user (such as verses, articles, videos, and courses), based on their needs and interests.
o Provide personalized support:  AI can provide personal support to users, by answering their questions, and providing them with guidance and guidance.
Examples of AI applications in management:
• Sentiment analysis:  AI can analyze the emotions expressed in Quranic verses "such as joy, sadness, anger, and fear," and understand the impact of these feelings on the reader.
• Identify characters and events:  AI can recognize the characters and events mentioned in the Holy Quran, and relate them to historical and geographical contexts.
• Create mind maps: AI can create mind maps of Quranic verses and surahs, illustrating the relationships between concepts and ideas.
• Develop a personal "management assistant": You can develop a smart application that acts as a personal assistant to the administrator, answering his questions, providing him with suggestions, and helping him organize his management.
Other emerging technologies and their potential role:
In addition to artificial intelligence, there are other emerging technologies that could contribute to the development of Quranic reflection, including:
• Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR):
o VR: Virtual reality can be used to create interactive environments that simulate the era in which the Qur'an was revealed, helping the contemplator to understand the historical and social context of the text, and to "experience" Qur'anic events.
o AR: Augmented reality can be used to display additional information about Quranic verses when the phone camera is pointed at them "such as translation, interpretation, various readings, reasons for revelation, and related hadiths."
• Blockchain :
o Ensuring authenticity: Blockchain can be used to ensure the authenticity and authenticity of digital manuscripts, and to prevent their manipulation or forgery.
o Ownership Tracking: Blockchain can be used to track the ownership of Quranic manuscripts, and to protect intellectual property rights.
•  Quantum Computing:
o Big Data Analysis: Quantum computing can be used to perform complex analyses on vast amounts of data related to the Holy Qur'an (such as texts, exegeses, commentaries, and manuscripts), which may reveal previously unknown secrets.
o Speed up research: Quantum computing can significantly speed up the process of searching Quranic texts, saving time and effort for researchers.
Potential challenges and risks:
Despite the significant benefits that technology can offer for Quranic reflection, there are challenges and risks that we must be aware of:
• Accuracy and Reliability:
o Ensure that the AI systems used in contemplation are accurate and reliable, and do not provide false or misleading interpretations, or contradict the consensus of the nation.
o These systems must undergo rigorous testing and be evaluated by specialized scientists.
• Sharia Ethics and Controls:
o Ethical and legal controls must be put in place for the use of artificial intelligence in reflection, which prevents its use for purposes that contradict the teachings of Islam, or lead to questioning the constants.
o There must be constant human oversight of these systems, to ensure that they do not spiral out of control.
• Bias and discrimination:
o Ensure that AI systems are unbiased to any category or group, and that they provide objective and fair explanations.
o These systems must be trained on diverse and comprehensive data, representing all perspectives.
• Excessive reliance on technology:
o The use of technology should not lead to over-reliance on it, neglect of the human mind and personal reflection.
o We must remember that technology is just a tool, and that true reflection is a work of the heart, mind and soul.
• Digital Divide:
o We must strive to bridge the digital divide, and provide technology to all Muslims, so that everyone can benefit from these tools.
The role of the manuscript digitization project in this future:
The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts represents an essential step towards this future, through:
• Providing infrastructure: Providing high-resolution digital manuscripts, which are the raw material on which artificial intelligence and other technologies can operate.
• Building the digital platform: Building an integrated digital platform, combining digital manuscripts, interactive tools and educational content.

D- "Political, Social and Psychological Constraints: An In-depth Analysis of Challenges"
Introduction:
The project of digitizing Qur'anic manuscripts, although it carries with it noble goals and an ambitious vision, is not without complex and intertwined challenges. These challenges are not limited to technical or financial aspects, but extend to political, social and psychological dimensions, which require deep analysis and careful understanding to deal with them effectively.
First: Political Obstacles:
1. Control and Control:
o Some governments may seek to censor the digital content of manuscripts, or block access to them, for fear of spreading "undesirable" or "oppositional" interpretations.
o Some regimes may try to monopolize the interpretation of the Qur'an and use it to serve their political interests.
2. Ideological conflicts:
o The project may face opposition from hardline religious groups, which consider open reflection a "heresy" or a "delusion."
o The project may be seen as part of a broader struggle between "formal Islam" and "popular Islam."
3. Lack of political will:
o Some governments may not be interested in supporting the project, due to other priorities or because of fear of risk.
Second: Social Obstacles:
1. Digital illiteracy and the digital divide:
o Many people may not be able to use the digital platform due to lack of digital skills or lack of devices and internet.
2. Traditions and customs:
o Some may reject the idea of open contemplation and prefer to adhere to traditional inherited interpretations.
o Some may consider that technology is contrary to religious values.
3. Fear of change:
o Some may fear that reflection will lead to changes in their understanding of religion or in their lifestyle.
Third: Psychological Obstacles:
1. Blind delivery:
o Some may have a blind "submission" to traditional interpretations, without a desire to think critically.
o They may consider that everything they need to know is already in these interpretations.
2. Fear of error:
o Some may fear misunderstanding the Qur'an, preferring to adhere to "safe" interpretations.
3. Inability to reflect:
o Some may feel unable to contemplate the Qur'an, and believe that this is only for scholars.
4. Lack of motivation:
o Some may not have sufficient motivation to contemplate the Qur'an, due to preoccupation with life or weak faith.
Deep Analysis:
These constraints are not separate from each other, but rather interrelated and interrelated. Political constraints can exacerbate social and psychological constraints, and vice versa. For example:
• Government censorship may limit people's access to information, increasing digital illiteracy and promoting blind delivery.
• Traditions and customs may make people more vulnerable to political and ideological influences.
• Fear of error may make people more reluctant to use technology or to express their opinions.
Proposed solutions "brief":

The project aims to revive the authentic reflection of the Holy Qur'an, transcending superficial reading and stereotyped interpretations, by returning to the text closer to the moment of revelation. The project is not limited to digitization, but also includes:
• Gradual management methodology:  inspired by the rituals of Hajj "preparation "fasting", maturity "consultation", publishing "Hajj"".
• Interactive digital tools: for manuscript comparison, research, and recording personal measures.
• Digital Society for Practitioners: A platform for communication, collaboration and exchange of experiences.
• A series of six books: provides a theoretical and practical framework for the project.
The importance of interactive digital manuscripts:
The book emphasizes that interactive digital manuscripts are not just digital copies, but enablers:
• Blind Submission Bypass: Encourages critical thinking and legacies examination.
• Liberation of the mind: opens up horizons for questioning, reflection, and transcending stereotypical understanding.
• Discovering hidden meanings: It helps to discover deeper connotations in the Qur'anic text.
• Personal reflection: Each individual was able to build their own "personal digital manuscript".
• Data Collection: Collecting and changing the opinions of the thinkers on the subject of reflection
• Add a fingerprint: Each contemplator adds their mark
The Four Book Series:
The series provides an integrated vision of the project, moving from theory to practice:
1. "Anwar al-Bayan fi Drawing the Ottoman Qur'an: Revealing the Secrets of the Tongue": focuses on the linguistic and rhetorical aspects of Ottoman painting.
2. "New Rules for the Qur'anic Arabic Tongue: Deduction from the Qur'anic Text and Evidence of the Original Manuscripts":  It is proposed to derive new linguistic rules from the Qur'anic text itself, using manuscripts.
3. "Contemplation in the Mirror of Drawings: Practical Applications of Digital Manuscripts in the Contemplation of the Qur'an": It provides practical applications for the use of manuscripts in contemplation.
4. "New Concepts and Interactive Reflection: The Qur'an in the Age of Digitization and Digital Manuscripts": The project links contemporary challenges and emphasizes the importance of technology and collective interaction.
Stages of reflection "from fasting to Hajj":
• Fasting "individual meditation": focusing on the text, using digital tools, recording personal measures "without publishing".
• Maturity "Consultation": review of measures with scientists and specialists.
• Hajj "Publication": Sharing mature "post-review" measures with the community.
Challenges and solutions:
The book discusses the challenges facing the project (political, social, psychological, technical, financial, legal) and proposes practical solutions.
Marketing & Communication:
The book emphasizes the importance of marketing the project and building an interactive community around it.
Future of the project:
The book foresees the future of Qur'anic reflection in light of technological developments "such as artificial intelligence".
Additional key points:
• Emphasizing the importance of the previous scientific heritage: not to start from scratch, but to build on what scientists have reached.
• "Personal Digital Manuscript": An essential tool in the project, enabling each individual to record their reflections and organize their understanding.
• Balance between tradition and modernity: combining respect for the original text with the employment of technology.
• Gradual application: starting with the individual, then private platforms, then national, then international.
• Building trust and partnerships: is the key to the success of the project.
• Awareness and Education:  The need to change misconceptions about reflection and digitization.
In general:
The book provides a comprehensive and ambitious vision of a project that aims to revolutionize how Muslims approach the Holy Quran in the digital age. The project focuses on empowering the individual, encouraging critical thinking, and building a knowledge society, while preserving authenticity and respect for scientific heritage.
