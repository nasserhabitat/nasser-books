            <h2>About This Book</h2>
            <p>What is this project?
It's not just a project to digitize old texts; it is:
•	An Invitation: To rediscover the Holy Qur'an, and to interact with it personally and deeply.
•	A Journey: To return to the roots, to the Qur'anic text in its form closest to the moment of revelation.
•	A Bridge: Linking the past and the present, and between tradition and modernity.
•	A Tool: To enable every Muslim to understand the Book of their Lord, contemplate its verses, and apply them in their life.
•	A Community: To build a global network of contemplators and researchers, working together to serve the Book of God.
