            <h2>About This Book</h2>
         <p> •	Unveiling the Treasures of Uthmanic Script: This book demonstrates that the Uthmanic script is not merely a method of writing, but a crucial key to a deeper understanding of the Qur'an's meanings. It highlights that the variations and apparent differences within the script carry profound implications for those who meticulously contemplate them.</p>
         <p> •	Connecting Uthmanic Script to Contemplation (Tadabbur): The book underscores the significant impact of the Uthmanic script in guiding contemplation (tadabbur), advocating for a transcendence of superficial interpretations towards a more profound and authentic understanding.</p>
         <p> •	Reliance on Digital Manuscripts: This work primarily draws upon digitized manuscripts of the Holy Mushaf attributed to Uthman ibn Affan, thereby offering a contemporary and objective analysis of the Qur'anic text.</p>
         <p> •	Corrects common mistakes: The book addresses some common errors in modern spelling of the Qur'an, and explains how these errors may hinder correct comprehension.</p>
