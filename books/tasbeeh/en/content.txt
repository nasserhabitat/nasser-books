1 INTRODUCTION 
Tasbeeh: Swimming in the Guided Path
From Inner Transcendence to Lived Submission
Nasser Ibn Dawood

Tasbeeh is not merely spoken remembrance,
nor a set of words repeated in isolation from life.
In its Qur’anic essence, Tasbeeh is a conscious movement—
an act of alignment within a guided order that governs existence itself.
Everything in the universe moves within a precise path:
the stars in their orbits,
the blood flowing within veins,
life unfolding according to laws that do not break themselves.
When a being moves in harmony with this guided order,
it is, in truth, performing Tasbeeh—
even if no word is uttered.
And when this harmony is disrupted,
when alignment gives way to rebellion,
corruption begins—
and the shedding of blood emerges as its most visible consequence.
This book proposes a re-reading of Tasbeeh,
not as a verbal ritual,
but as a lived orientation toward Divine order.
It traces a journey
from inner transcendence to practical surrender,
from remembrance as utterance
to submission as embodied action.
Through Qur’anic language, symbolic analysis,
and reflective reasoning,
the reader is invited to rediscover Tasbeeh
as a principle of harmony,
a law of life,
and a path toward restoring balance
within the self and the world.

3 LINGUISTIC SYMBOLISM: THE ROOT SABAHA AND THE CODE OF BLOOD
In this chapter, we move from the surface of words
to the depth of roots, and from immediate meanings
to the inner structure of meaning and life itself.

The Qur’anic language does not operate through random wording.
Every root carries a direction,
every letter participates in meaning,
and every term unfolds within a living semantic system.
The root sabaha—from which Tasbeeh is derived—
does not originally signify speech or praise.
Its primary meaning is movement:
to swim, to flow, to move smoothly within a medium
without resistance or rupture.
Swimming is not chaos.
It is motion within containment,
freedom governed by law,
movement that respects the nature of the surrounding medium.
This is the first key:
Tasbeeh, at its root, is not sound—
it is alignment in motion.
In contrast, the Qur’an repeatedly associates corruption
with the shedding of blood.
Blood, in its deepest symbolic function,
is not merely a physical substance.
It is the carrier of life,
the flowing witness of internal order.
When blood flows within its proper channels,
life is preserved.
When it is spilled,
order collapses.
Thus, blood becomes the counter-symbol of Tasbeeh.
Tasbeeh is flowing within the path.
Bloodshed is the breaking of the path.
This symbolic contrast reveals a profound Qur’anic logic:
corruption is not defined primarily by intention,
but by disruption of order.
Where alignment is preserved,
life flourishes.
Where alignment is broken,
violence emerges.
From this perspective, Tasbeeh is not optional devotion.
It is the very principle that safeguards life.
To abandon Tasbeeh—
not merely in speech, but in orientation—
is to drift away from the guided path
and toward fragmentation, conflict, and loss.

The root "sabaha" can be summarized as follows:
- **S (Sin)**: Represents continuous movement and flow.
- **B (Ba)**: Signifies guided initiation or beginning.
- **H (Ha)**: Denotes containment and completion, ensuring no deviation.

The code of blood ("dam" as d + m):
- **D (Dal)**: Energy of directed push and guidance.
- **M (Mim)**: Energy of encompassing, gathering, and wholeness.

4 ENRICHING TASBEEH AS A VITAL ENERGY AND THE HIDDEN TREASURES OF TASBEEH
In this chapter, we move from linguistic meaning
to living impact, and from concept
to the latent energy carried by Tasbeeh.

Tasbeeh, when reduced to utterance alone,
loses its transformative power.
But when understood as alignment with a guided order,
it reveals itself as a source of vitality.
Life does not persist through randomness.
It is sustained through rhythm, balance,
and continuous renewal.
Where harmony is preserved, energy flows.
Where harmony is disrupted, energy dissipates.
Tasbeeh operates within this logic.
It is not an external addition to life,
but a restorative act that reactivates balance
within the human being and the surrounding world.
The Qur’anic vision consistently links remembrance
with life, light, and expansion,
while linking heedlessness
with constriction, darkness, and decay.
This is not merely spiritual symbolism.
It reflects a deeper principle:
alignment generates vitality.
When consciousness is oriented toward order,
the inner system regains coherence.
Thought, emotion, and action
begin to move in the same direction.
In this sense, the “hidden treasures” of Tasbeeh
are not mystical rewards detached from reality,
but emergent effects of restored alignment:
clarity of perception,
inner tranquility,
and resilience in the face of disruption.
Tasbeeh nourishes life
because it reopens the path of flow.

The hidden treasures can be summarized as:
- **Health Treasure**: Restores bio-energy balance, countering illness as disrupted harmony.
- **Material Treasure**: Opens sustenance through practical actions like social repair and environmental stewardship.
- **Psychological and Spiritual Treasure**: Fosters repentance, fear removal, and inner peace.
- **Cosmic Treasure**: Aligns with universal flow, making one a channel for Divine abundance.

5 THE ESSENTIAL CONCEPT OF TASBEEH:
TRANSCENDENCE BEYOND WORDS AND THE REVIVAL OF THE GUIDED PATH
In this chapter, we move from remembrance as utterance
to Tasbeeh as a lived reality that revives the guided path.

The essential error in approaching Tasbeeh
lies in separating it from movement.
Words alone do not sustain order.
They may point to meaning,
but they do not replace orientation.
In the Qur’anic framework, transcendence (tanzeeh)
does not imply distance from life,
but liberation from false constraints—
from illusions that distort perception
and fragment action.
Tasbeeh, therefore, is not repetition.
It is release.
Release from arrogance,
from self-centered gravity,
from the illusion of autonomous control.
When transcendence is internalized,
the path reappears.
The guided path is not imposed externally.
It emerges naturally
when the inner compass is restored.
At this level, Tasbeeh becomes an existential act.
It aligns intention, direction, and movement.
The human being no longer resists the order of life,
but flows within it.
This is why Tasbeeh revives the path:
it removes the internal obstacles
that caused deviation in the first place.

6 A NEW INTERPRETATION OF TASBEEH:
SWIMMING IN THE GUIDED PATH AND THE LOGIC OF BLOODSHED AS CORRUPTION
In this chapter, we move from transcendence
to law, and from harmony with the path
to understanding corruption as departure from it.

The Qur’an does not frame corruption
primarily as moral failure,
but as structural deviation.
When the angels questioned the creation of humanity,
their concern was not abstract sin,
but the potential for bloodshed—
the visible sign of disorder.
Bloodshed, in this reading,
is not merely an act of violence.
It is the rupture of flow,
the collapse of internal and external alignment.
Tasbeeh stands at the opposite pole.
To “swim” in the guided path
is to move freely without breaking the medium,
to act without tearing the fabric of order.
Corruption begins
when movement turns into collision,
when freedom detaches itself from guidance.
This reframes ethical responsibility.
Good and evil are no longer evaluated
only by intention or outcome,
but by alignment.
Does an action preserve the path
or fracture it?
Does it sustain flow
or produce rupture?
From this perspective, Tasbeeh is law-abiding motion,
while bloodshed represents lawless interruption.
The Qur’anic narrative thus reveals
a consistent logic:
order preserves life,
and deviation consumes it.
Tasbeeh is not an ornament of faith.
It is its structural foundation.


7 UNDERSTANDING SUBHANAK:
DIVINE TRANSCENDENCE BEYOND MEASURE
In this chapter, we move from Tasbeeh as an act
to Subhanak as a manifestation of a greatness beyond measure.

The expression Subhanak is not merely a declaration of praise.
It is a recognition of transcendence—
an acknowledgment that Divine reality
cannot be contained by human categories,
laws, or limitations.
When the Qur’an places Subhanak
on the tongues of angels and prophets,
it signals a moment of epistemic humility:
a point where understanding halts
and surrender begins.
To say Subhanak
is to withdraw false projections,
to absolve the Divine
from the limitations imposed by human expectation.
In this sense, Subhanak is not distance from God,
but liberation from distortion.
It clears the ground
so that alignment may occur
without resistance or illusion.

8 FORMS OF TASBEEH IN THE QUR’AN AND THE SUNNAH
In this chapter, we move from a singular concept
to Qur’anic diversity, and from abstract meaning
to its lived manifestations in revelation.

The Qur’an does not confine Tasbeeh
to one form, one time, or one voice.
Tasbeeh appears as speech and silence,
as motion and stillness,
as conscious choice and natural law.
Everything in existence is described
as participating in Tasbeeh—
each according to its mode of being.
This diversity does not fragment the concept.
It confirms its universality.
Human Tasbeeh becomes meaningful
when it consciously joins
what the universe already performs by nature.
Thus, remembrance is not imposed upon creation.
It is an invitation to awareness.

The forms of Tasbeeh can be summarized as follows:

| 
TypeDescriptionExamplesRitualisticPerformed in structured worship.In prayer (salah) and remembrances (adhkar).CosmicNatural submission of creation.Planets in orbits, mountains, and all beings as in Al-Isra':44.VoluntaryConscious individual or collective choice.Personal reflection or group praise.Symbolic/PracticalEmbodied through actions.Qur’anic contemplation, righteous deeds, and earth reform.
9 THE ESSENTIAL CONCEPT OF SUJOOD:
EMBODIED SUBMISSION AND COMPLETE SURRENDER
In this chapter, we move from Tasbeeh as conscious movement
to Sujood as practical surrender and complete submission.

If Tasbeeh represents alignment in motion,
then Sujood represents grounding within that alignment.
Sujood is often reduced to a physical posture,
yet in the Qur’anic vision,
it is a comprehensive state of being.
The linguistic root of sajada points first
to smooth, unobstructed movement—
a surface that yields without resistance.
Only later does it come to signify prostration.
This linguistic origin reveals an essential truth:
Sujood is not humiliation.
It is the absence of resistance.
To perform Sujood is not merely to lower the body,
but to release opposition—
to stop pushing against the order of life.
In prayer, Sujood marks the summit of nearness
because it is the moment
when intention, body, and direction converge.
Nothing remains elevated against the order.
Nothing insists on its own gravity.
The Qur’an distinguishes
between momentary prostration (sujjadan)
and continuous states of submission (sajideen).
The first describes an act.
The second describes an orientation.
True Sujood is not confined to a moment.
It extends into time,
shaping behavior, choices, and responses.
From this perspective, Sujood completes Tasbeeh.
Tasbeeh clears the inner path.
Sujood commits the self to walking it.
Where Tasbeeh restores direction,
Sujood stabilizes it.
Together, they form a single movement:
alignment without resistance.


10 THE PRACTICAL DIMENSION OF TASBEEH AND SUJOOD:
FROM WORDS TO ACTIONS
In this chapter, we move from words
to actions, and from worship
to its tangible impact on life.

Words that do not shape behavior
remain incomplete.
The Qur’anic vision does not separate
inner devotion from outward conduct.
Alignment must translate into action,
or it dissolves into abstraction.
Tasbeeh refines intention.
Sujood disciplines response.
Together, they regulate how the human being
moves within society,
handles power,
and responds to disruption.
True worship leaves a trace.
It reduces harm,
restrains excess,
and preserves balance.
Where Tasbeeh and Sujood are authentic,
they manifest as ethical clarity
and responsible action.

11  ILLNESS AND THE ABSENCE OF TASBEEH:
HEALING AS RESTORED ALIGNMENT
In this chapter, we move from harmony
to disruption, and from the absence of Tasbeeh
to the emergence of illness.

Illness, in the Qur’anic perspective,
is not always punishment.
Often, it is a signal—
a manifestation of imbalance.
When alignment weakens,
the system compensates.
Symptoms emerge
where coherence has been lost.
Tasbeeh restores orientation.
It reconnects the inner system
to its guiding order.
Healing, therefore, is not only treatment.
It is realignment.

12 BIOPHOTONS:
SCIENTIFIC INDICATIONS OF VITAL ENERGY
In this chapter, we move from the Qur’anic vision
to scientific indications, without separating
meaning from energy.

Modern research reveals
that living cells emit subtle light—
biophotons—
suggesting that life communicates
through organized energy.
This does not replace revelation,
nor does it explain it away.
It offers resonance.
Where the Qur’an speaks of light,
science begins to observe structure.
Meaning and energy
are not opposing domains.
They intersect
where order is preserved.

13 THE VERSE OF HEALING:
TEXT, PURPOSE, AND MERCY
In this chapter, we move from text
to purpose, and from recitation
to mercy and healing.

The Qur’an describes itself
as healing and mercy for believers.
This healing is not mechanical.
It unfolds through engagement,
understanding, and trust.
Recitation becomes effective
when it opens awareness
and restores orientation.
Healing flows
where meaning is received
without resistance.


14 ADDITIONAL QUR’ANIC EXAMPLES OF HEALING
In this chapter, we move from principle
to illustration, and from foundation
to Qur’anic application.

The Qur’an does not present healing
as an abstract promise,
but as a recurring pattern woven into its narratives.
Each story of healing
reveals a restoration of alignment
before it reveals relief of pain.
Whether healing appears as physical recovery,
emotional release,
or spiritual reassurance,
it consistently follows the return to trust,
patience, and surrender.
These examples confirm a central insight:
healing unfolds
when resistance dissolves
and coherence is restored.

15 THE STORY OF PROPHET AYYUB (JOB):
A COMPLETE MODEL OF HEALING
In this chapter, we move from example
to a complete model of patience, surrender, and healing.

The story of Prophet Ayyub is not primarily
a story of suffering.
It is a story of integrity under pressure.
Ayyub does not argue with destiny,
nor does he accuse existence.
He remains aligned
even as hardship intensifies.
When relief finally comes,
it is not portrayed as reward for complaint,
but as the natural outcome
of sustained surrender.
Healing, in this narrative,
is the return of flow
after endurance without rebellion.

16 THE CREATION OF ADAM AND THE COMMAND TO PROSTRATE:
THE CONFRONTATION WITH ARROGANCE
In this chapter, we move from obedience
to arrogance, and from Tasbeeh
to the first deviation from the path.

The command to prostrate before Adam
was not about honoring clay,
but about honoring Divine wisdom.
The refusal of Iblis
was not ignorance,
but arrogance—
the insistence on self-defined superiority.
This moment marks
the first fracture in alignment:
the preference of self-reference
over guided order.
Corruption begins here—
not with violence,
but with resistance to truth.

17 AL-ISRA’ AND HAJJ:
JOURNEYS OF TASBEEH AND SUJOOD
In this chapter, we move from the earth
to ascension, and from physical journey
to spiritual passage.

Al-Isra’ represents elevation without escape.
Hajj represents movement without dispersion.
Both journeys discipline direction.
Neither allows wandering without purpose.
In Al-Isra’, the Prophet ascends
while remaining bound to responsibility.
In Hajj, humanity moves collectively
while dissolving hierarchy.
These journeys teach
that true elevation
occurs within order,
not beyond it.

18 SUJOOD IN SURAH AL-HAJJ:
THE SUBMISSION OF THE COSMOS
In this chapter, we move from human submission
to the submission of the entire cosmos
to the Divine plan.

Surah Al-Hajj expands the scope of Sujood
beyond humanity.
The heavens, the earth,
the sun, the moon,
and all living beings
are described as participating
in a universal act of submission.
This is not symbolic exaggeration.
It is a statement of structure.
Everything that exists
moves according to a prescribed order.
Sujood is the name
given to this obedience.

19 SURAH AN-NASR:
VICTORY, GRATITUDE, AND RENEWAL
In this chapter, we move from victory
to gratitude, and from achievement
to renewal through Tasbeeh.

Surah An-Nasr reframes success.
Victory is not an endpoint,
but a test of orientation.
The command that follows victory
is not celebration,
but Tasbeeh and seeking forgiveness.
Renewal protects success
from turning into arrogance.
Where gratitude governs power,
corruption is restrained.

20 AL-HAMD AND MUHAMMAD:
FROM COSMIC OVERFLOW TO EMBODIED MESSAGE
In this chapter, we move from the overflow of creation
to the embodiment of the message, and from praise
to the perfected human model.

Praise, in the Qur’anic vision,
is not flattery.
It is recognition of coherence.
The name Muhammad emerges
from the same root as hamd—
signaling a life
that fully reflects praise through action.
Here, meaning becomes embodied.
The message walks among humanity.



21 THE SPIRITUAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:
WHY “RELIGION” IS AN OPERATING SYSTEM AND “IDEOLOGY” BECOMES A MENTAL VIRUS
In this chapter, we move from religion as a life-system
to unveiling what distorts awareness
and corrupts belief.

The Qur’anic concept of deen is not an ideology competing with others.
It is an operating system—
a comprehensive framework that organizes perception, values, and action.
When religion is reduced to slogans or rigid doctrines,
it loses its integrative function
and becomes vulnerable to distortion.
Ideology, unlike deen,
operates by isolating fragments of truth
and absolutizing them.
What begins as conviction
can quickly turn into mental rigidity.
This rigidity behaves like a virus:
it overrides discernment,
disrupts balance,
and spreads conflict.
Tasbeeh and Sujood function here as safeguards.
They restore humility,
maintain openness to correction,
and prevent belief from hardening into domination.
Spiritual safety is not achieved by control,
but by continuous alignment.

22 “INDEED ALLAH AND HIS ANGELS SEND BLESSINGS UPON THE PROPHET”:
COSMIC AWARENESS AND INNER CONNECTION
In this chapter, we move from earthly connection
to cosmic communion, and from remembrance
to existential interaction.

The Qur’anic declaration
that Allah and His angels send blessings upon the Prophet
is not a ceremonial statement.
It reveals a dimension of cosmic participation.
Here, prayer transcends individuality.
It becomes synchronization
with a universal current of meaning.
Sending blessings is not imitation.
It is alignment—
a conscious entry into an ongoing flow
of mercy, order, and guidance.
The human being does not initiate this connection.
He joins it.

23 
COSMIC HARMONY AND DIVINE TRANQUILITY:
A QUR’ANIC READING OF ENERGY AND AWARENESS
In this chapter, we move from conflict
to harmony, and from dispersion
to Divine serenity.

Tranquility in the Qur’an
is not emotional numbness.
It is the quiet stability
that emerges when systems align.
Where awareness is fragmented,
anxiety prevails.
Where alignment is restored,
serenity descends.
The Qur’an describes this serenity
as a Divine descent—
not because it comes from outside life,
but because it restores coherence within it.
Harmony is not the absence of movement.
It is movement without collision.

24 
THE WORD AND CREATION:
THE SECRET OF EXPRESSION IN QUR’ANIC PHILOSOPHY
In this chapter, we move from expression
to creation, and from the Word
to the formation of existence.

In the Qur’anic worldview,
the Word is not a symbol.
It is an act.
Creation unfolds through command,
meaning through articulation.
When words lose integrity,
reality fragments.
When words align with truth,
they generate coherence.
Thus, ethical speech
is not secondary to action.
It is one of its foundations.

25 
SPIRITUAL AND PHYSICAL HEALING:
THE BODY AS A MIRROR OF AWARENESS
In this chapter, we move from awareness
to the body, and from inner reality
to visible effect.

The body does not merely carry the self.
It reflects it.
Internal conflict expresses itself physically.
Likewise, restored awareness
manifests as balance and resilience.
Healing, in this sense,
is not escape from the body,
but reconciliation with it.
When awareness aligns,
the body follows.

26 TOWARD COMPREHENSIVE SERVITUDE:
TASBEEH AND SUJOOD AS A COMPLETE WAY OF LIFE
In this chapter, we move from partial understanding
to an integrated vision, and from worship
to a complete way of life.

Servitude in the Qur’anic sense
is not confinement.
It is coherence.
Fragmented worship produces fragmented lives.
Rituals detached from orientation
lose their unifying power.
Comprehensive servitude emerges
when Tasbeeh and Sujood
extend beyond moments of devotion
and become principles of existence.
Tasbeeh aligns perception.
Sujood aligns action.
Together, they restore wholeness.
A life grounded in Tasbeeh
does not resist reality,
nor does it submit blindly to chaos.
It recognizes order,
moves within it,
and preserves it.
A life grounded in Sujood
does not seek dominance,
nor does it flee responsibility.
It accepts limits
as conditions for harmony.
In this integrated vision,
faith is no longer an abstract belief,
nor a private emotion.
It becomes a lived system—
one that safeguards balance
within the self and the world.
The Qur’an does not call humanity
to withdrawal from life,
but to conscious participation within it.
Tasbeeh and Sujood,
when understood in this light,
are not rituals added to existence.
They are the architecture that holds it together.


27 BOOK SUMMARY
A UNIFIED VISION OF THE GUIDED PATH
In this chapter, we move from detail
to a unified vision of the entire path.

This book has traced Tasbeeh
from word to movement,
from ritual to orientation,
from abstraction to lived coherence.
Tasbeeh was revealed
as conscious alignment within a guided order.
Sujood emerged
as embodied surrender to that order.
Together, they form
a complete path—
one that preserves life,
restrains corruption,
and restores balance.
The Qur’anic call is not withdrawal from existence,
but participation within it—
with awareness, humility, and responsibility.



28 GLOSSARY OF KEY CONCEPTS
Tasbeeh
A state of conscious alignment with the Divine order.
Beyond verbal praise, Tasbeeh signifies moving in harmony with the guided path of existence, preserving balance and coherence in thought, intention, and action.

Sujood
Embodied submission and practical surrender.
Not merely physical prostration, but the absence of resistance to truth and order. Sujood represents grounding within alignment and commitment to live according to it.

Guided Path
The structured order governing existence according to Divine wisdom.
It is not an imposed route, but a natural trajectory that emerges when awareness is aligned and resistance dissolves.

Tanzeeh (Transcendence)
Liberation of the Divine from human limitations and projections.
Tanzeeh clears perception from distortion, enabling genuine alignment rather than abstract glorification.

Subhanak
An expression of epistemic humility acknowledging Divine transcendence beyond measure.
It marks the point where understanding yields to surrender without negation of meaning.

Alignment
The state in which intention, perception, movement, and action converge within the guided order.
Alignment generates vitality, coherence, and tranquility.

Corruption (Fasaad)
Structural deviation from the guided order.
Corruption manifests when movement becomes collision, freedom detaches from guidance, and alignment collapses—often expressed as violence or systemic harm.

Bloodshed
The visible rupture of alignment and flow.
In this work, bloodshed is understood as a sign of deep structural disorder rather than an isolated moral failure.

Deen
A comprehensive operating system for life.
Unlike ideology, deen integrates belief, ethics, awareness, and action into a coherent framework that sustains balance.

Ideology
A fragmented system of thought that absolutizes partial truths.
When detached from humility and alignment, ideology functions as a mental virus that distorts awareness and generates conflict.

Tranquility (Sakina)
The quiet stability that emerges from restored alignment.
Not emotional numbness, but deep coherence within movement and change.

Healing
The restoration of alignment across awareness, body, and existence.
Healing unfolds when resistance dissolves and coherence returns, manifesting spiritually, psychologically, and physically.

Word (Kalima)
An act of creation and ordering.
In the Qur’anic worldview, the Word is not symbolic alone—it generates structure, meaning, and reality when aligned with truth.

Cosmic Participation
The synchronization of human awareness with universal order.
Acts such as prayer and blessing are understood as conscious entry into an ongoing current of meaning rather than isolated rituals.

Comprehensive Servitude
A coherent way of life where Tasbeeh and Sujood extend beyond rituals into perception, ethics, and responsibility.
It represents freedom through alignment, not confinement through obligation.

29  NASSER IBN DAWOOD LIBRARY: INTRODUCTION TO THE LIBRARY, METHODOLOGY, AND ACCESSIBILITY POLICY

29.1 NASSER IBN DAWOOD LIBRARY – GENERAL INTRODUCTION
Nasser Ibn Dawood Library is an open digital library containing my works in Quranic sciences, contemplation (tadabbur), and contemporary Quranic studies. It is designed to be compatible with automated search and artificial intelligence, facilitating crawling through its content, analyzing its texts, and internally linking its concepts.

The library aims to contribute to decoding the semantic structure of the Holy Quran through contemplation, tracking Quranic expression patterns, and working on what I call the "Quranic tongue" as a self-contained semantic system derived from the text itself.

As of December 27, 2025, the library contains 46 continually updated books (23 in Arabic and 23 in English), with versions and content updated whenever scientific review requires it.

29.2 STANDING AT THE THRESHOLD OF GRATITUDE
This work is but a drop in the ocean of Quranic contemplation. Every understanding is the fruit of an encounter between the text, the mind, the context, and the experiences of contemplators across time.

In this journey, I have stood at the thresholds of many minds and enlightened hearts, borrowing light from them and drawing insight, with direct or indirect influence in shaping this path. Therefore, this section is not a formal introduction, but an acknowledgment of grace, and a recognition that contemplation is a collective effort, not attributable to an individual no matter how much they exert.

29.3 ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Nasser Ibn Dawood  
Civil engineer specializing in metals, and researcher in Quranic studies.  
Graduate of the Polytechnic Faculty – University of Mons (Belgium).  
Born in Morocco: April 27, 1960.  
Retired employee, currently dedicated to research and authorship.

His work focuses on:  
- Quranic linguistics and the structure of Quranic terminology  
- Digital text and manuscript analysis  
- Contemporary methodologies for contemplation and linking the Quran to reality  

This work is the fruit of an intersection between:  
Engineering, language, contemplation, and reflection on divine laws  
Without claiming to reach absolute truth, but striving to approach it.

29.4 THE GOVERNING METHODOLOGICAL STATEMENT
All books in this library proceed from a single fixed methodology, based on:

29.4.1 Nature of What is Presented
Everything presented in these books is:  
Human endeavors and contemplations that are not infallible  
They may be correct or mistaken, do not represent a final interpretation of God's Book, and do not obligate anyone to follow them.  
Rather, they are offered as attempts at understanding, presented with evidence, leaving the reader free to accept or reject them,  
For guidance is a choice, and accountability is individual.

29.4.2 Collective Contemplation
We believe that contemplation is:  
A collective, cumulative, open process  
In which visions integrate, minds intersect, without monopolizing truth or sanctifying human understanding.  
The ultimate authority is for the Quranic text alone, not for persons or methodologies.

29.4.3  Continuous Review and Acknowledgment of Error
We consider that:  
Acknowledging error is a scientific virtue  
And reviewing endeavors is an ethical duty.  
Accordingly, the content of these books is subject to review, modification, and deletion whenever a flaw is revealed.  
Stability is for the text, not for understanding.

29.4.4 Ethics of Disagreement
This project adheres to clear Quranic ethics:  
- No belittling  
- No accusations of betrayal  
- No intellectual guardianship  
- No conflict in the name of religion  

﴿There is no compulsion in religion﴾  
Disagreement is a norm, guidance is a choice, and accountability is individual.

29.4.5  Guidelines for Following the New
We welcome contemporary endeavors and contemplative renewal, provided:  
- Internal harmony of the Quranic text  
- Reliance on reason, innate disposition, and God's laws  
- Balance between heritage and contemporary endeavor  
- Rejection of sanctifying persons  

In compliance with the Quranic methodology: ﴿Those who listen to the word and follow the best of it﴾

29.4.6 The Comprehensive Methodology: Security and Peace
The governing methodology for these books is:  
The methodology of security and peace  
Security of thought from blind sanctification  
And peace of discourse from incitement  
And peace in the relationship with God and creation

29.5 ACCESSIBILITY POLICY
Believing that Quranic knowledge is a shared right not to be monopolized,  
All library books are made available for free and without charge, allowing copying and distribution provided the source is cited without alteration.  
Available formats: PDF – HTML – TXT – DOCX  
Languages: Arabic and English  
Design: Compatible with all devices

29.6 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND QURANIC RESEARCH
The library is designed to be compatible with artificial intelligence tools, as an aid for:  
- Search  
- Summarization  
- Conceptual analysis  

With emphasis that:  
Artificial intelligence results are approximations that are not infallible,  
And do not substitute for direct reading and personal contemplation.  
This project focuses on analyzing terminology from within the Quranic tongue itself, not from abstract dictionaries.

29.9 CONCLUSION
This work is a humble effort, presented before God and then before you.  
Every correctness in it is from God, and every error is from myself.  
I ask God to benefit those who read or contemplate it,  
And to place it in the balance of good deeds for my parents, and everyone who taught me and guided me to goodness.  
﴿Our Lord, accept [this] from us. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing﴾  
And praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.
