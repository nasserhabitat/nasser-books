                <h2>Introduction to the Book</h2>
                <p><strong>In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful</strong></p>
                <p>Amidst a world swirling with noise and turbulent waves of information, an eternal question remains deep within the soul: If God exists, in what language does He speak to us today? Did revelation truly fall silent with the passing of the last of the prophets, or does the language of heaven still echo throughout the universe for those who listen attentively?</p>
                
                <p>The conviction that confines the "Word of God" to sacred texts and voices heard by the apostles in ancient times leaves the contemporary soul with a sense of spiritual orphanhood, as if we were inhabitants of a world abandoned by its Creator after He completed His mission. However, what if the "Word of God" were not a historical event that had passed, but rather a living and ongoing cosmic process? What if the "delegations from heaven"—from Adam to Christ—were not merely passing figures, but rather original models of consciousness and divine revival programs whose echoes continue to resonate within us and with us, awaiting those who will activate them in their life's journey?</p>
                
                <p>This book is not an interpretation, but rather an invitation to journey into the depths of the "clear Arabic tongue," not merely as a language, but as a divine code and a unique cognitive system. It is an attempt to delve into the "unclear" meanings that elude a superficial, literal reading, to discover how the story of Christ and his mother, Mary, is not merely a historical event, but a living roadmap for every human soul yearning for the birth of a new consciousness.</p>
                
                <p>It is a journey to learn how to be "Mary" in the courage to reject outdated intellectual legacies, and how to revive the "Christ" hidden deep within us, so that we may be a revival program in our reality, and a force that erases the ignorance of minds and the deadness of hearts. Are you ready to contemplate what has not been revealed to many?</p>

                <h3>Conclusion: Be the Next Delegation</h3>
                <p>At the conclusion of our journey through the hidden meanings in the story of Christ and Mary, we reach a point that is not the end, but rather the beginning of responsibility. Together, we have tried to dust off the timeless symbols of the Qur'an—not to count them, but to revive them in our reality.</p>
                
                <p>We began with "Mary"—that pure soul who taught us that the birth of the true "Word" requires a "mihrab" of inner silence, and the courage to withdraw from the noise of the world. We saw in her a model for every consciousness preparing to receive divine inspiration. Then "Christ" was revealed to us—not only as a historical miracle, but as a renewable "revival program" and a divine "Word" that carries within it the code of both knowledge and faith, and an invitation for every human to wipe away the genes of aggression from their soul and revive the dead lands of consciousness in their surroundings.</p>
                
                <p>This book was not written to be read, but to be lived. It is an explicit invitation for every reader to transcend the role of recipient, to become themselves a "coming delegation," carrying the torch of contemplation and reviving these meanings in their life.</p>
                
                <p>May you be "Mary" in the mihrab of your mind, receiving revelation and challenging assumptions.</p>
                <p>May you be "Christ" in your actions, a program of revival and peace wherever you are.</p>
                <p>May you be among the "Supporters of God" who support the principle, not persons, and truth, not desire.</p>
                
                <p>The Qur'an is not a history book, but rather a "way of life" and an operating system for human consciousness. Today, this book entrusts you with the responsibility of questioning and the key of contemplation. So set out on your own journey, to discover the hidden treasures of the Qur'an, and be yourself a living sign of its signs, and a delegation from its heaven.</p>
