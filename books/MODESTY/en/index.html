            <h2>About This Book</h2>
            <p>This book, titled "New Concepts and Interactive Contemplation: The Qur'an in the Age of Digitization and Digital Manuscripts </p>
             <p> This is where the journey of this book begins. But it will not be just a traditional review of texts, but a practical application of a new methodology of understanding, aimed at diving into the depths of the "Quranic Arabic tongue" to discover its treasures from within. This methodology, which we detailed in our book "The Jurisprudence of the Qur'anic Tongue: A New Approach to Understanding the Text and the Manuscript", is based on the belief that the Qur'an is an integrated structure that interprets itself, and that the rules of its understanding are derived from its own linguistic and cognitive structure. It is a call to revive "authentic contemplation" that transcends blind imitation and is subject to the authority of the text and its inner logic.
This new jurisprudence is based on methodological foundations, the most important of which are: understanding the intrinsic connotations of "letter names", and considering the "mathani" – literal pairs – as the pivotal structural system that reveals the "kinetic meaning" of words and negates synonymy. By applying these tools, we hope to provide a deeper and more authentic understanding of modesty creation, revealing its inner and tight logic, linking it to the laws of the universe and life, and highlighting its renewed miracle.

It is an attempt to move from treating the word "modesty" and its derivatives as static symbols, to sensing them as living beings carrying the secrets of the Creator and creation. We will dive into the definition of modesty linguistically and idiomatically, and read the verses that explicitly and implicitly mentioned it, and reflect on the modesty of God, which befits His majesty, and the modesty of His honorable prophets, and stop at the unique Qur'anic models that embodied it.
More importantly, this book will seek to present a new vision, which presents "modesty" not only as a moral end, but as a prerequisite and an indispensable cognitive tool for understanding the Book of God. We will reveal how this heartfelt creation is the compass that guides the process of contemplation, and how it is the antidote that heals superficial understanding, and it is the key that opens the doors of wisdom in God's words, all through the lens of this method, which we hope will be the gateway to new contemplation and renewed understanding.
