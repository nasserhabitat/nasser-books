            <h2>About This Book</h2>
            <p>It is an attempt to move from treating the word "modesty" and its derivatives as static symbols, to sensing them as living beings carrying the secrets of the Creator and creation.
                We will dive into the definition of modesty linguistically and idiomatically, and read the verses that explicitly and implicitly mentioned it, and reflect on the modesty of God,
                which befits His majesty, and the modesty of His honorable prophets, and stop at the unique Qur'anic models that embodied it.
More importantly, this book will seek to present a new vision, which presents "modesty" not only as a moral end, but as a prerequisite and an indispensable cognitive tool for understanding the Book of God.
                We will reveal how this heartfelt creation is the compass that guides the process of contemplation, and how it is the antidote that heals superficial understanding,
                and it is the key that opens the doors of wisdom in God's words, all through the lens of this method, which we hope will be the gateway to new contemplation and renewed understanding.
