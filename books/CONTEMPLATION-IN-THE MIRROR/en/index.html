            <h2>About This Book</h2>
            <p>The most prominent ideas and topics covered in the book </p>
             <p>   1.	Contemplation as a method for understanding the Qur'an </p>
             <p>  2.	Criticism of traditional interpretations</p>
              <p> 3.	The Qur'an as the sole reference:
              o	The book emphasizes that the Qur'an is the only source of guidance and legislation, and that the Sunnah of the Prophet is a statement and application of what is stated in the Qur'an, and not a resigned barrier to legislation.
              o	He questions the authenticity of some hadiths, especially those that contradict the Qur'an or distort the image of the Prophet.</p>
              <p>  4.	Rationality in Islam:
        o	The book calls for a balance between reason and transmission, and emphasizes that Islam urges the use of reason in understanding religious texts.
       o	Stresses the importance of ijtihad in understanding texts and applying them to contemporary reality, taking into account the controls of Sharia.</p>
             <p>  In short, "contemplation of the Qur'an" is a call for a renewal of religious understanding and a focus on the Qur'an as the primary source of guidance, emphasizing the importance of reflection and critical thinking, a return to the original Qur'anic manuscripts, and the adoption of the "jurisprudence of the seven Mathani" methodology for a deeper understanding of the Qur'a.</p>
